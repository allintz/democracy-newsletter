            <h1>When Local Officials Become the Last Line: Understanding County-Level Election Certification</h1>

            <p><strong>Epistemic status:</strong> High confidence on basic mechanics and documented 2020/2022 examples. Moderate confidence on predictions about future vulnerability patterns, as institutional responses are still evolving.</p>

            <p>If you followed the 2020 and 2022 election cycles closely, you probably remember dramatic moments at the state level—Vice President Pence refusing to reject electoral votes, Georgia's Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger standing firm against pressure. These made headlines.</p>

            <p>But there's a less visible chokepoint in American democracy that deserves much more attention: the thousands of county election boards and canvassing commissions that certify results before they ever reach state officials.</p>

            <p>These local bodies—often consisting of just three to five ordinary citizens appointed to part-time roles—have become a critical vulnerability point. And unlike state officials who face national scrutiny, county commissioners often work in obscurity, making decisions in small government buildings with minimal media coverage.</p>

            <p>Let me walk you through why this matters, what we've already seen go wrong, and why 2026 and 2028 could see more sophisticated attempts to exploit this weakness.</p>

            <h2>How County Certification Actually Works</h2>

            <p>Before your vote reaches anyone at the state level, it goes through a local process most voters never think about.</p>

            <p>Here's the basic sequence: After Election Day, county election staff count ballots and compile results. Then—and this is the key step—a county board of canvassers or election commissioners must vote to certify those results as accurate. This is supposed to be a ministerial duty, meaning they're just confirming the count was done properly, not making judgments about who should have won.</p>

            <p>Only after county certification do results go to the state, where the Secretary of State (or equivalent) aggregates them and certifies statewide totals. Then those certified state results become the basis for appointing presidential electors.</p>

            <p>According to research from the <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/local-election-officials-survey-march-2024">Brennan Center for Justice</a>, there are approximately 10,000 election jurisdictions in the United States. Each has some form of local certification process, though the exact rules vary by state.</p>

            <p>The system assumes these local officials will do their job routinely. But what happens when they don't?</p>

            <h2>Wayne County, Michigan: The 2020 Warning Shot</h2>

            <p>On November 17, 2020, the Wayne County Board of Canvassers met to certify election results from Michigan's largest county, which includes Detroit.</p>

            <p>The board had four members—two Republicans and two Democrats. The vote should have been routine. Election staff had completed the canvass. No evidence of fraud had been presented. Biden had won the county by over 330,000 votes.</p>

            <p>But the two Republican board members, Monica Palmer and William Hartmann, initially voted against certification. According to <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/11/18/wayne-county-canvassers-board-certification-votes/6337188002/">reporting from the Detroit Free Press</a>, Palmer cited minor discrepancies in poll books from Detroit precincts—the kind of small clerical errors that occur in every election and don't affect vote totals.</p>

            <p>The vote deadlocked 2-2. Wayne County's results were not certified.</p>

            <p>For several hours, Michigan's electoral votes hung in limbo. If Wayne County couldn't certify, could Michigan certify its statewide results? Without Michigan's electoral votes, what would happen to the national outcome?</p>

            <p>The two Republican members eventually reversed their decision after immense public pressure during a Zoom meeting that drew thousands of observers. But as <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/18/politics/wayne-county-michigan-certification/index.html">CNN documented</a>, they later tried to rescind their certification votes, signing affidavits claiming they'd been pressured—though this attempt had no legal effect.</p>

            <p>The incident revealed something crucial: a handful of local officials, citing trivial administrative discrepancies, could nearly derail certification of results from 870,000 voters.</p>

            <h2>The Pattern Expands in 2022</h2>

            <p>Wayne County wasn't an isolated incident. It was a beta test.</p>

            <p>In the 2022 midterms, county-level certification battles became routine in multiple states. The organization Protect Democracy tracked these attempts and found that <a href="https://protectdemocracy.org/work/the-canvass-2022-midterms/">officials in at least six states initially refused or attempted to refuse certification</a> of routine election results.</p>

            <p>Let me give you three examples:</p>

            <p><strong>Cochise County, Arizona:</strong> Two Republican county supervisors refused to certify the November 2022 results by the legal deadline, citing unfounded concerns about ballot tabulator certification. According to <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/11/28/cochise-county-arizona-supervisors-refuse-canvass-election-results/69686374007/">Arizona Republic reporting</a>, this affected approximately 47,000 votes. The supervisors only certified after a court order and threat of criminal charges. The delay demonstrated how even unsuccessful refusals create chaos and undermine public confidence.</p>

            <p><strong>Otero County, New Mexico:</strong> In June 2022, the county commission refused to certify primary election results based on distrust of Dominion voting machines—despite no evidence of problems. As documented by <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/06/15/1105328261/new-mexico-county-refuses-certify-election-results">NPR</a>, the New Mexico Supreme Court had to order certification. One commissioner was later removed from office, but only after the crisis had passed.</p>

            <p><strong>Luzerne County, Pennsylvania:</strong> The board of elections deadlocked on certifying 2022 results after problems with paper ballot shortages on Election Day—actual administrative issues, but ones that were resolved and didn't affect outcome accuracy. According to <a href="https://www.votebeat.org/pennsylvania/2022/11/22/23473495/luzerne-county-certification-paper-shortage-election-results/">court filings reviewed by Votebeat</a>, a court had to intervene to force certification.</p>

            <p>What connects these cases? In each one, local officials—often motivated by election conspiracy theories—used their position in the certification chain to create obstacles, delays, and legal battles.</p>

            <p>None of these attempts succeeded in overturning an election outcome. But that's not really the point.</p>

            <h2>Why This Vulnerability Is Growing</h2>

            <p>Here's what concerns me about county certification as a vector for election subversion:</p>

            <p><strong>First, it's scalable.</strong> You don't need to flip hundreds of officials. In a close presidential election, preventing certification in just a few counties in one or two swing states could be enough to create a crisis. Michigan came down to about 150,000 votes in 2020. Blocking certification in Wayne County alone could have prevented the state from certifying its results by the federal deadline.</p>

            <p><strong>Second, local officials are easier to capture than state-level officials.</strong> County election board positions often draw little attention. Many are appointed rather than elected. In some states, <a href="https://www.votingrightslab.org/blog/who-controls-our-elections">as documented by Voting Rights Lab</a>, state legislatures or party organizations directly appoint county board members. This means organized efforts to place election deniers in these positions can happen without much public notice.</p>

            <p><strong>Third, the legal framework is ambiguous.</strong> While state laws generally describe certification as "mandatory" or "ministerial," they rarely specify what happens if a county board refuses. Can courts compel certification? How quickly? What if board members simply don't show up? These questions got tested in 2022, but we still don't have consistent answers across states.</p>

            <p><strong>Fourth, the personal cost to local officials is significant.</strong> Unlike governors or secretaries of state who have security details and legal support, county commissioners are often part-time officials with day jobs. According to a <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/local-election-officials-survey-march-2024">March 2024 survey by the Brennan Center</a>, one in three local election officials reported experiencing threats or harassment. When faced with pressure from their own party, threats from activists, or even physical intimidation, resisting becomes much harder.</p>

            <h2>The 2024 Reforms (And Their Limits)</h2>

            <p>After the 2022 close calls, some states took action.</p>

            <p>Michigan passed legislation requiring county canvassers to certify results and removing ambiguity about the ministerial nature of the duty. According to <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/legislative-efforts-protect-election-administration-2023">analysis by the Brennan Center</a>, at least eight states strengthened their certification procedures between 2022 and 2024.</p>

            <p>The 2022 Electoral Count Reform Act also helped at the federal level by clarifying that governors have the final say in certifying electors—reducing the impact of county-level delays on federal deadlines.</p>

            <p>But significant gaps remain:</p>

            <li>Many states still lack clear enforcement mechanisms for compelling county certification</li>
            <li>Criminal penalties for refusing to certify exist in some states but are rarely used</li>
            <li>The timeline between Election Day and federal deadlines (now 41 days after the ECRA) is long enough for litigation, but potentially too short for complex multi-jurisdiction legal battles</li>
            <li>There's no federal protection for local officials facing threats or harassment</li>

            <h2>What This Could Look Like in 2026 or 2028</h2>

            <p>Let me sketch a plausible scenario that keeps me up at night:</p>

            <p>Imagine a presidential election where the outcome in one swing state comes down to 50,000 votes. Let's say Wisconsin, where Biden won by about 20,000 in 2020.</p>

            <p>Now imagine that in the two years leading up to the election, party organizations in that state have systematically worked to place election-denying activists on county canvassing boards in three mid-sized counties. This happens quietly, through appointments that get minimal press coverage.</p>

            <p>After Election Day, the losing candidate is behind by 50,000 votes statewide. But these three county boards—representing 80,000 votes combined—refuse to certify results. They cite minor discrepancies, demand "full forensic audits," or simply express lack of confidence in the process.</p>

            <p>The state has 10 days until its certification deadline. Litigation begins immediately. But courts are backlogged, judges are cautious about appearing political, and the legal questions are genuinely complex in that state's law.</p>

            <p>Even if courts eventually order certification, the delays eat up time. If the process drags past state or federal deadlines, does the state send electoral votes at all? Does the legislature claim authority to appoint electors directly? Does the election get kicked to the House?</p>

            <p>None of this requires the blockage to succeed permanently. The goal is chaos, ambiguity, and competing claims to legitimacy.</p>

            <h2>Bottom Line: What This Means for Democracy Projects</h2>

            <p>County-level election administration is where the abstract threat of democratic backsliding becomes concrete and operational.</p>

            <p>The good news: This is a solvable problem. The mechanisms of local certification are understandable, the number of key positions is finite, and legal reforms can clarify duties and enforcement.</p>

            <p>The bad news: We're in a race between institutional hardening and increasingly sophisticated subversion attempts. The 2020 and 2022 attempts were relatively unsophisticated—officials acted on impulse or pressure rather than coordinated strategy. Future attempts will likely be more organized.</p>

            <p><strong>If you're thinking about projects in the democracy space, here are three directions that seem high-leverage:</strong></p>

            <li><strong>Legal clarity campaigns:</strong> Work with state legislators to pass laws explicitly requiring county certification, establishing fast-track court procedures for enforcement, and creating clear penalties for refusal. Organizations like <a href="https://protectdemocracy.org/">Protect Democracy</a> and <a href="https://statesuniteddemocracy.org/">States United Democracy Center</a> are already doing this work and could use support.</li>

            <li><strong>Monitoring and transparency:</strong> Build systems to track county certification processes in swing states, identify at-risk jurisdictions, and ensure public attention when problems emerge. This is largely unglamorous data work, but it's exactly the kind of thing that prevents problems from happening in obscurity.</li>

            <li><strong>Support and protection for local officials:</strong> Programs that provide legal assistance, security consultation, and emotional support for local election officials facing pressure. The <a href="https://www.secureelections.org/">Committee for Safe and Secure Elections</a> works on this, but the scale of need far exceeds current resources.</li>

            <p>The most important insight is that democratic institutions aren't self-enforcing. They depend on ordinary people in unglamorous positions doing routine administrative tasks correctly, even under pressure.</p>

            <p>We've now seen what happens when that assumption breaks down. The question is whether we'll harden these vulnerabilities before they're exploited more successfully.</p>
