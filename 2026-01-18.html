            <h2>When State Legislatures Nearly Stole Presidential Elections: A History of the "Contingent Election" Loophole</h2>

            <p><strong>Epistemic status:</strong> High confidence on historical facts (all well-documented), moderate confidence on assessing future risk given changing political dynamics.</p>

            <p>You've probably heard about the Electoral College. But did you know there's a little-used backup mechanism that's almost been weaponized multiple times to override the popular vote? It's called a "contingent election," and understanding how it works—and how it's been exploited historically—is crucial for anyone working on election security.</p>

            <p>Here's why this matters now: The contingent election mechanism creates an incentive for state legislatures to prevent <em>any</em> candidate from reaching 270 electoral votes. And that incentive has shaped real subversion attempts in American history.</p>

            <h3>What's a Contingent Election?</h3>

            <p>The Constitution has a plan B if no presidential candidate wins a majority of electoral votes (currently 270 out of 538). According to the <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/amendment-12/">Twelfth Amendment</a>, the House of Representatives then chooses the president—but with a crucial twist.</p>

            <p>Each state delegation gets exactly one vote. So Wyoming (population 580,000) has the same power as California (population 39 million). A candidate needs 26 state delegations to win.</p>

            <p>Right now, Republicans control more state delegations than Democrats, even when Democrats control more total House seats. After the 2024 elections, Republicans controlled 26 state delegations, Democrats controlled 22, and 2 were tied, according to <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Party_control_of_state_delegations_to_the_U.S._House_of_Representatives">Ballotpedia's analysis</a>.</p>

            <p>This creates a perverse incentive: If you're losing the Electoral College, your best move might be to prevent anyone from reaching 270. Then your party's advantage in state delegations could hand you the presidency anyway.</p>

            <h3>The 1800 Crisis: When the System Almost Broke Immediately</h3>

            <p>The contingent election mechanism was stress-tested almost immediately. In 1800, Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr (running mates on the same ticket) tied at 73 electoral votes each due to a ballot design flaw.</p>

            <p>The House voted 36 times over seven days in February 1801. According to <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?291342-5/magnificent-catastrophe">historian Edward Larson's research in "A Magnificent Catastrophe,"</a> Federalist congressmen nearly deadlocked the election indefinitely rather than let Jefferson win. Some states had armed militias ready to march on the capital.</p>

            <p>The crisis was so severe that it produced the Twelfth Amendment (ratified 1804), which separated presidential and vice presidential voting. But it kept the contingent election mechanism—and that's created problems ever since.</p>

            <h3>1876: The Only Election Actually Stolen</h3>

            <p>The election of 1876 involved what historians widely consider the most successful election subversion in US history. Democrat Samuel Tilden won the popular vote and was one electoral vote short of victory, with 20 electoral votes disputed across Florida, Louisiana, and South Carolina.</p>

            <p>Republicans controlled the state governments in these three states. According to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Reconstruction-Americas-Unfinished-Revolution-1863-1877/dp/0062354515">Eric Foner's "Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution,"</a> these states submitted competing elector slates—Republican ones certified by Republican officials, Democratic ones certified by Democratic officials or rival governments.</p>

            <p>Sound familiar? This is the historical precedent for the fake electors scheme in 2020.</p>

            <p>Congress created an Electoral Commission to resolve the dispute: 8 Republicans and 7 Democrats. The Commission voted 8-7 along party lines to award all 20 disputed votes to Republican Rutherford B. Hayes, giving him a 185-184 Electoral College victory despite losing the popular vote.</p>

            <p>Democrats accepted this result only as part of the <a href="https://www.history.com/topics/us-presidents/compromise-of-1877">Compromise of 1877</a>, which ended Reconstruction and withdrew federal troops from the South. As <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1918216">historian C. Vann Woodward documented</a>, this compromise enabled decades of violent disenfranchisement of Black voters.</p>

            <p>The subversion succeeded. And it shows how partisan control of state election machinery can interact with contingent election scenarios to override voters.</p>

            <h3>1948: Strom Thurmond's Strategy to Force a Contingent Election</h3>

            <p>In 1948, segregationist Democrats (the "Dixiecrats") explicitly pursued a contingent election strategy. Their candidate Strom Thurmond didn't expect to win outright. The plan was to win enough Southern electoral votes to prevent either major candidate from reaching 270.</p>

            <p>According to <a href="https://uncpress.org/book/9780807847411/the-dixiecrat-revolt-and-the-end-of-the-solid-south/">historian Kari Frederickson's "The Dixiecrat Revolt,"</a> Thurmond's campaign calculated that if they forced a contingent election, Southern Democrats could trade their votes to whichever major candidate promised to oppose civil rights legislation.</p>

            <p>They won four states and 39 electoral votes. But President Truman performed better than expected, winning 303 electoral votes outright and avoiding the contingent election trap.</p>

            <p>The strategy failed—but it demonstrated that forcing a contingent election is a recognized tactic for minority factions to exercise outsized power.</p>

            <h3>1960: Nearly Happened Again</h3>

            <p>The 1960 election was incredibly close. Kennedy won 303 electoral votes to Nixon's 219, with 15 going to segregationist Harry Byrd.</p>

            <p>But according to <a href="https://wwnorton.com/books/9780393349702">David Greenberg's research in "Republic of Spin,"</a> if Nixon had flipped just two states (Illinois and Texas, where fraud allegations swirled), neither candidate would have reached 270. Democrats controlled 23 state delegations, Republicans controlled 20, with 7 split or uncertain.</p>

            <p>The outcome would have been genuinely unpredictable. Nixon chose not to contest the results, later claiming (somewhat self-servingly) that he wanted to preserve democratic stability during the Cold War.</p>

            <h3>1968: George Wallace's Explicit Contingent Election Strategy</h3>

            <p>In 1968, segregationist George Wallace ran the most sophisticated contingent election campaign in modern history. His campaign was explicit about the strategy: win enough Southern and border states to prevent Nixon or Humphrey from reaching 270, then negotiate.</p>

            <p>Wallace won five Deep South states and 46 electoral votes. According to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Politics-Rage-George-Wallace-Transforming/dp/0807121053">Dan Carter's biography "The Politics of Rage,"</a> Wallace's campaign chairman told supporters that if they forced a contingent election, Wallace would have "the power to determine who the president would be."</p>

            <p>The strategy nearly worked. Nixon won 301 electoral votes—just 31 more than needed. If Wallace had won one or two more border states he was competing in (Tennessee, Kentucky, or North Carolina), Nixon would have fallen short.</p>

            <p>Wallace's campaign demonstrated that the contingent election isn't just a theoretical curiosity. It's a viable power grab strategy for a well-organized regional candidate.</p>

            <h3>Why This Matters for 2026 and 2028</h3>

            <p>Understanding contingent elections helps explain the strategic logic behind certain types of election subversion.</p>

            <p>Consider the 2020 fake electors scheme. Yes, it was designed to give Vice President Pence a pretext to reject electoral votes. But it had a backup purpose too: if enough states' electoral votes were "disputed," neither candidate might reach 270.</p>

            <p>If the fake electors scheme had created enough confusion about who won in seven states (totaling 84 electoral votes), Trump might have prevented Biden from reaching 270 even without Pence's cooperation. The election would then go to the House, where Republicans controlled 26 state delegations.</p>

            <p>For 2028, here's the vulnerability: A candidate doesn't need to win states outright to force a contingent election. They just need to prevent the winner from being certified in enough states to keep them under 270.</p>

            <p>This could happen through:</p>

            <li><strong>State legislatures refusing to certify results</strong> (claiming fraud or irregularities)</li>
            <li><strong>Competing elector slates</strong> creating "disputes" that delay or prevent certification</li>
            <li><strong>A strong third-party candidate</strong> winning electoral votes in a close race</li>
            <li><strong>Faithless electors</strong> (though the Electoral Count Reform Act has made this harder)</li>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/8873/text">Electoral Count Reform Act of 2022</a> closed some loopholes, including clarifying that the Vice President's role is purely ceremonial and raising the threshold for congressional objections. But it didn't eliminate the contingent election mechanism itself or prevent state-level subversion that creates "disputed" results.</p>

            <h3>The Current Risk Level</h3>

            <p>How worried should we be? I'd say moderately concerned but not panicking.</p>

            <p><strong>Factors that make this harder now:</strong></p>
            <li>The Electoral Count Reform Act makes it harder to object to legitimate electoral votes</li>
            <li>The fake electors scheme failed and participants faced legal consequences, creating deterrence</li>
            <li>Election officials are more aware of these tactics after 2020</li>

            <p><strong>Factors that still create vulnerability:</strong></p>
            <li>The contingent election mechanism remains unchanged in the Constitution</li>
            <li>State legislatures could still potentially refuse to certify results they don't like</li>
            <li>In a genuinely close election (say 270-268), removing even one state's votes could force a contingent election</li>
            <li>Republican advantage in state delegations creates asymmetric incentives</li>

            <p>The key insight: You don't need a nationwide conspiracy. You just need enough dysfunction or obstruction in states representing 37+ electoral votes to prevent anyone reaching 270.</p>

            <h3>Bottom Line: Project Ideas</h3>

            <p><strong>For the reader building projects in democracy protection:</strong></p>

            <p>The contingent election loophole represents a category of vulnerability that's hard to address through normal election security work. It requires <strong>constitutional-level thinking</strong>, not just procedural reforms.</p>

            <p><strong>Potential high-impact projects:</strong></p>

            <li><strong>State Delegation Monitoring:</strong> Build a real-time tracker of which party controls which state House delegations, updated after every special election. Make it a go-to resource for journalists and advocates. (No organization currently maintains this with the prominence it deserves.)</li>

            <li><strong>Contingent Election Scenario Planning:</strong> Work with <a href="https://protectdemocracy.org/">Protect Democracy</a> or similar groups to develop specific legal strategies for defending against bad-faith attempts to force contingent elections. What lawsuits could you pre-file? What evidence would you need?</li>

            <li><strong>Third-Party Risk Assessment:</strong> In a polarized environment, even a well-meaning third-party candidate could accidentally create contingent election risk in a close race. Develop frameworks for assessing this risk in real-time during campaigns.</li>

            <li><strong>Constitutional Amendment Campaign:</strong> Long-term project to replace the Electoral College with the National Popular Vote. Organizations like <a href="https://fairvote.org/">FairVote</a> are working on this, but it needs more resources and state-level organizing.</li>

            <li><strong>Bipartisan State Delegation Norm-Building:</strong> Create incentives for state delegations to commit publicly that they would vote for whoever won the most electoral votes if forced into a contingent election (similar to Nixon's restraint in 1960).</li>

            <p>The history here is clear: The contingent election mechanism has repeatedly tempted political actors to subvert majority rule. The only reason it hasn't succeeded recently is that the Electoral College margins haven't been close enough. But in a genuinely close election—especially one where bad actors control key state legislatures—this centuries-old constitutional vulnerability could become the primary vector for election subversion.</p>

            <p>We got lucky that the 2020 election wasn't closer. We might not be lucky next time.</p>
