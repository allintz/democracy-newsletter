            <h1>How Hungary's Democratic Backsliding Actually Happened (And Why the Specifics Matter)</h1>

            <p><strong>Epistemic status:</strong> High confidence on the basic timeline and mechanisms. Drawing on established political science research and journalistic documentation. Less certain about which lessons transfer cleanly to the US context—institutional differences matter a lot.</p>

            <p>You've probably heard Hungary mentioned as an example of democratic backsliding. Maybe you've seen Viktor Orbán described as an "illiberal democrat" or heard vague references to "erosion of democracy." But what actually happened? And more importantly—what's the playbook?</p>

            <p>Today I want to walk through the specific mechanisms Orbán used to consolidate power after winning office democratically in 2010. Not because Hungary and the US are identical (they're not), but because understanding the precise tactics helps us recognize similar patterns elsewhere.</p>

            <h2>The Setup: A Constitutional Supermajority</h2>

            <p>Here's what made Hungary vulnerable: Orbán's Fidesz party won 68% of parliamentary seats in 2010 despite getting only 53% of the vote. According to <a href="https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/how-orbans-fidesz-party-is-transforming-hungary/">research by political scientists Kim Lane Scheppele and R. Daniel Kelemen</a>, this gave Fidesz a two-thirds supermajority—enough to amend Hungary's constitution unilaterally.</p>

            <p>This is crucial. Orbán didn't need to stage a coup or suspend democracy. He could reshape institutions legally.</p>

            <p>The US parallel isn't perfect, but consider: what if one party controlled the White House, had supermajorities in both houses of Congress, and also controlled enough state legislatures to pass constitutional amendments? The institutional constraints would be different, but not insurmountable.</p>

            <h2>Step One: Rewrite the Rules of the Game</h2>

            <p>Orbán's first major move was passing a new constitution in 2011—the Fundamental Law. <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2013/01/16/hungary-democracy-under-threat">As documented by Human Rights Watch</a>, this wasn't just symbolic. The new constitution:</p>

            <li>Weakened the Constitutional Court's power to review legislation, especially on fiscal matters</li>
            <li>Changed how constitutional court judges were selected, ensuring Fidesz could pack it</li>
            <li>Redefined Hungary's official identity in explicitly nationalist, Christian terms</li>

            <p>But here's what made it particularly insidious: Orbán embedded his policy preferences directly into constitutional text. Things like tax policy, family structure definitions, and the role of churches became constitutional matters. This meant future governments couldn't simply pass new laws—they'd need to amend the constitution.</p>

            <p>Think of it as coding your political agenda into the operating system rather than just installing your preferred applications.</p>

            <h2>Step Two: Capture the Referees</h2>

            <p>Next, Fidesz systematically captured independent oversight institutions. <a href="https://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/9781963788068/post-communist-mafia-state/">Political scientist Bálint Magyar's research on "mafia state" dynamics</a> documents how this worked:</p>

            <p><strong>The Constitutional Court:</strong> Fidesz expanded the court from 11 to 15 judges, then immediately filled the new seats with loyalists. Sound familiar? This is court-packing, but done gradually enough to maintain a veneer of legality.</p>

            <p><strong>The Electoral Commission:</strong> According to <a href="https://www.osce.org/odihr/elections/hungary/99216">analysis by the OSCE election monitoring mission</a>, Fidesz restructured the National Election Commission to ensure pro-government majorities, giving them control over election administration and vote counting disputes.</p>

            <p><strong>The Media Council:</strong> Hungary created a new media regulatory body with five members, all appointed by Fidesz. <a href="https://freedomhouse.org/country/hungary/freedom-world/2024">Freedom House documentation</a> shows this body then used licensing and regulatory powers to pressure critical media outlets.</p>

            <p><strong>The Prosecutor's Office:</strong> The chief prosecutor, appointed to a nine-year term, became effectively immune from oversight. Investigations into government corruption mysteriously stalled.</p>

            <p>The pattern: take institutions that are supposed to referee politics impartially, and ensure they're staffed by loyalists. Not necessarily through direct corruption, but through procedural changes that seem technical but have profound effects.</p>

            <h2>Step Three: Tilt the Electoral Playing Field</h2>

            <p>Here's where it gets particularly relevant for understanding US vulnerabilities. Orbán didn't ban opposition parties or cancel elections. He just made it nearly impossible for them to win.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23248823.2020.1712906">Research by political scientists Noémi Lévi and Róbert László</a> documents how Fidesz gerrymandered electoral districts to maximize their seat advantage. Combined with winner-take-all rules in single-member districts, this meant Fidesz could win two-thirds of parliamentary seats with just 44% of the vote in 2014.</p>

            <p>But the manipulation went beyond maps. According to <a href="https://www.direkt36.hu/en/">reporting by Direkt36, Hungary's investigative journalism center</a>, the government:</p>

            <li>Changed campaign finance rules to advantage incumbents</li>
            <li>Used state advertising budgets to reward friendly media and starve critical outlets</li>
            <li>Employed public resources (billboards, government messaging) for partisan purposes</li>
            <li>Granted citizenship to ethnic Hungarians abroad who reliably voted for Fidesz</li>

            <p>None of this was technically illegal under the system Fidesz had created. That's the point—they changed what "legal" meant.</p>

            <h2>Step Four: Economic Capture</h2>

            <p>One mechanism that's often overlooked: Orbán used state power to create a class of dependent oligarchs. <a href="https://www.occrp.org/en/investigations/the-money-machine-how-a-high-flying-hungarian-oligarch-tried-to-build-an-empire">As detailed in investigative reporting by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project</a>, businesses close to Fidesz received preferential treatment in government contracts, EU fund allocations, and regulatory matters.</p>

            <p>This created a wealthy business class whose fortunes depended on Fidesz staying in power. They then used that wealth to fund pro-government media, provide cushy jobs for retiring Fidesz officials, and finance political campaigns.</p>

            <p>It's a feedback loop: political power generates economic benefits for allies, who then use economic resources to maintain political power.</p>

            <h2>Why the Specifics Matter</h2>

            <p>You might be thinking: "Okay, but Hungary is a parliamentary system with different institutions. How does this apply to the US?"</p>

            <p>Fair question. The mechanisms won't transfer exactly. But the pattern reveals something important: <strong>democratic backsliding doesn't require dramatic ruptures</strong>. It happens through accumulated institutional changes that seem individually defensible but collectively transform the system.</p>

            <p>Consider potential US parallels:</p>

            <li><strong>Court capture:</strong> We've seen debates about Supreme Court expansion and lower court packing</li>
            <li><strong>Election administration:</strong> Secretary of state races now involve candidates who openly question election legitimacy</li>
            <li><strong>Media environment:</strong> Not through formal regulation (First Amendment prevents that), but through market concentration and partisan realignment</li>
            <li><strong>Constitutional hardball:</strong> Using procedural powers to their maximum extent (Senate filibusters, executive orders, emergency declarations)</li>

            <p>None of these are identical to Hungary's experience. American federalism, stronger civil society institutions, and different constitutional structures create meaningful differences. But the underlying logic—use the powers you have to change the rules in ways that entrench your power—that's portable.</p>

            <h2>The Counterfactuals That Didn't Happen</h2>

            <p>It's worth noting what did NOT stop Orbán:</p>

            <li><strong>International pressure:</strong> Hungary faced EU criticism but calculated (correctly) that the costs would be manageable</li>
            <li><strong>Opposition protests:</strong> Large demonstrations occurred but couldn't overcome institutional disadvantages</li>
            <li><strong>Media exposure:</strong> Independent journalists documented everything, but in a captured system, exposure isn't enough</li>
            <li><strong>Economic consequences:</strong> Some foreign investment declined, but EU funds and friendly oligarchs filled gaps</li>

            <p>What might have made a difference? <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/how-to-save-a-constitutional-democracy/537E66A0C7E7C1D5F8D3D1F0D3A8E9F5">Political scientist Tom Ginsburg's research</a> suggests: stronger legislative opposition willing to use procedural tools creatively, an independent judiciary that acted earlier and more forcefully, or international institutions with real enforcement mechanisms.</p>

            <p>But here's the hard truth: once a party has a constitutional supermajority and is willing to use it maximally, institutional checks become much weaker.</p>

            <h2>Bottom Line and Key Takeaways</h2>

            <p>The Hungary case teaches us several things relevant for democracy protection work:</p>

            <p><strong>1. Prevention is much easier than cure.</strong> Once institutions are captured, reversing the process is extraordinarily difficult. This suggests focusing on early warning signs and preventive safeguards rather than waiting for crisis.</p>

            <p><strong>2. Formal rules matter less than who controls them.</strong> A beautiful constitution or well-designed electoral system provides little protection if the people administering it are partisan actors. This means secretary of state races, election board appointments, and judicial selection deserve much more attention.</p>

            <p><strong>3. Gradual erosion can be more durable than dramatic ruptures.</strong> Orbán's approach has lasted 15+ years precisely because it maintained democratic aesthetics (elections still happen!) while hollowing out democratic substance.</p>

            <p><strong>4. Single-party supermajorities are extremely dangerous.</strong> Whatever your partisan preferences, institutional design should prevent any party from gaining unchecked power to rewrite fundamental rules.</p>

            <p><strong>For project ideas:</strong> There's a notable gap in US-based organizations doing comparative institutional analysis. Most democracy groups focus either on voting rights or on international democracy promotion, but few systematically track how other democracies structure things like election administration, judicial selection, or media regulation to resist capture.</p>

            <p>A valuable project might be a "Democracy Institutional Design Database"—systematically documenting how different democracies handle these questions and what trade-offs they involve. When US state legislatures or Congress debate structural reforms, they'd have concrete comparative data rather than just theoretical arguments.</p>

            <p>Existing organizations doing related work include <a href="https://protectdemocracy.org/">Protect Democracy</a> (focused on US institutional vulnerabilities) and <a href="https://www.idea.int/">International IDEA</a> (comparative constitutional design), but there's room for more US-focused institutional analysis that learns from international cases like Hungary.</p>

            <p>The 2026 midterms and 2028 presidential election won't look like Hungary's trajectory. But some of the mechanisms—court capture, election administration politicization, constitutional hardball—are already visible in US politics. Understanding how they worked elsewhere helps us recognize them here, while there's still time to respond.</p>
