            <h1>The Independent State Legislature Theory: How a Fringe Legal Idea Nearly Gave State Legislatures Unchecked Power Over Elections</h1>

            <p><strong>Epistemic status:</strong> High confidence on the factual history and legal arguments; moderate confidence on predictions about future deployment of similar theories.</p>

            <p>There's a particular kind of legal argument that should make anyone interested in election security very nervous. It goes like this: "The Constitution gives state <em>legislatures</em> the power to determine election rules. Therefore, state legislatures can do whatever they want with elections, and nobody—not state courts, not governors, not even state constitutions—can stop them."</p>

            <p>This argument, known as the Independent State Legislature (ISL) theory, came terrifyingly close to becoming constitutional law in 2023. If it had succeeded, it would have handed state legislatures essentially unchecked power over federal elections. Let me walk you through why this matters, how it almost succeeded, and what it means for future election threats.</p>

            <h2>What the Theory Actually Claims</h2>

            <p>The ISL theory rests on a specific reading of two clauses in the U.S. Constitution. Article I, Section 4 says that "the Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof." Article II, Section 1 contains similar language about presidential electors.</p>

            <p>Here's where it gets interesting. ISL proponents argue that when the Constitution says "Legislature," it means <em>only</em> the legislative body—not the normal lawmaking process that includes gubernatorial vetoes, state constitutional constraints, or state court review.</p>

            <p>The practical implications are enormous. Under this theory, a state legislature could:</p>
            <li>Gerrymander congressional districts immune from state court review</li>
            <li>Change election rules right before an election without gubernatorial approval</li>
            <li>Potentially override election results by declaring irregularities and appointing their own electors</li>
            <li>Ignore provisions in their own state constitution that protect voting rights</li>

            <p>As election law scholar Richard Hasen explained in a <a href="https://electionlawblog.org/?p=130201">2022 analysis</a>, "The most extreme version of the theory would allow state legislatures to override the popular vote in presidential elections by choosing electors directly."</p>

            <h2>The Theory's Journey from Fringe to Mainstream</h2>

            <p>The ISL theory wasn't always taken seriously. For most of American history, as documented in <a href="https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2022/07/21/the-supreme-courts-partisan-turn/">legal historian Michael Klarman's research</a>, everyone understood that state legislatures operated within their state constitutional systems, subject to normal checks and balances.</p>

            <p>But the theory gained traction in Bush v. Gore (2000). Chief Justice Rehnquist's concurrence, joined by Justices Scalia and Thomas, suggested that state courts might be overstepping when they interpreted state election law. This was just a concurrence, not binding precedent, but it planted a seed.</p>

            <p>The theory really exploded in 2020. After Trump lost, his lawyers deployed ISL arguments to argue that swing state legislatures could simply ignore Biden's popular vote victories and appoint their own Trump electors. The argument failed everywhere it was tried, but four Supreme Court Justices indicated openness to the theory.</p>

            <p>Then came Moore v. Harper, a case about North Carolina's congressional maps that reached the Supreme Court in 2022-2023.</p>

            <h2>How Close We Came: Moore v. Harper</h2>

            <p>North Carolina's Republican-controlled legislature drew aggressively gerrymandered congressional maps in 2021. The state Supreme Court struck them down under the North Carolina Constitution's free elections clause. The legislature argued this was unconstitutional—that state courts had no power to review their congressional maps at all.</p>

            <p>According to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/12/07/1140918262/supreme-court-north-carolina-redistricting-independent-state-legislature">NPR's detailed reporting on the case</a>, if the Supreme Court had adopted the strong version of ISL theory, "state legislatures would have near-absolute power over federal elections, unchecked by state courts or state constitutions."</p>

            <p>Four Justices had already signaled sympathy for ISL ideas. It genuinely looked like the theory might win.</p>

            <p>Here's what made this terrifying in the context of 2020: the fake elector scheme I covered on January 15th relied partly on ISL reasoning. The memos supporting that scheme argued state legislatures could reclaim their "constitutional authority" over choosing electors even after an election had occurred. A Supreme Court endorsement of ISL would have provided legal cover for exactly that kind of maneuver.</p>

            <h2>The Theory Finally Fails (For Now)</h2>

            <p>In June 2023, the Supreme Court rejected the ISL theory in Moore v. Harper by a 6-3 vote. Chief Justice Roberts' majority opinion, as analyzed by <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/2023/06/court-rejects-independent-state-legislature-theory/">SCOTUSblog</a>, held that while state legislatures do have a special role in federal elections, they remain subject to state constitutional constraints and state court review.</p>

            <p>This was a huge relief. But here's what keeps me up at night: three Justices dissented. And the majority opinion left some wiggle room, suggesting that state courts couldn't "transgress the ordinary bounds of judicial review" when reviewing election laws.</p>

            <p>What are the "ordinary bounds of judicial review"? Nobody really knows. As <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/what-the-supreme-courts-decision-in-moore-v-harper-means-for-american-democracy/">election law professor Ned Foley noted</a>, this vague standard "leaves open the possibility of federal court intervention if state courts are perceived as going too far."</p>

            <h2>Why This Still Matters for 2026 and 2028</h2>

            <p>Even though ISL lost, the underlying strategy is very much alive. Here's why you should keep paying attention:</p>

            <p><strong>First, the theory can be resurrected.</strong> Supreme Court precedents can be overturned. If the Court's composition changes, ISL could return. The three dissenters in Moore v. Harper (Justices Thomas, Alito, and Gorsuch) are still on the Court.</p>

            <p><strong>Second, the vague "ordinary bounds" language creates new litigation opportunities.</strong> Conservative litigants are already testing what counts as state courts going "too far." Any aggressive state court decision protecting voting rights could face federal challenge on these grounds.</p>

            <p><strong>Third, the political incentives haven't changed.</strong> As I discussed in the contingent election newsletter on January 18th, there are scenarios where a state legislature might want to override its state's popular vote. ISL theory provided a constitutional argument for doing exactly that. Even though the strongest version failed, watered-down versions might still provide cover for legislative interference.</p>

            <p><strong>Fourth, state supreme courts matter enormously now.</strong> Since Moore v. Harper preserved state court review of election laws, the composition of state supreme courts has become a critical check on legislative overreach. <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/state-supreme-courts-and-elections">Brennan Center research</a> shows that many state supreme court races are now being flooded with money from partisan groups who understand these courts' new importance.</p>

            <h2>The Pattern We Should Watch</h2>

            <p>Here's the broader pattern that ISL exemplifies:</p>

            <li><strong>Find a constitutional ambiguity.</strong> The Constitution's language about state "legislatures" was always slightly unclear.</li>

            <li><strong>Develop a fringe legal theory</strong> that interprets the ambiguity in a way that serves partisan interests. For years, ISL was fringe.</li>

            <li><strong>Normalize the theory through repetition.</strong> Get it into concurrences, dissents, and law review articles. Make it sound respectable.</li>

            <li><strong>Deploy it when the stakes are highest.</strong> Use it in litigation when control of government hangs in the balance.</li>

            <li><strong>Even if it fails, the Overton window has shifted.</strong> The "compromise" position becomes something that would have seemed extreme before.</li>

            <p>This is exactly how ISL evolved from fringe theory to nearly controlling Supreme Court doctrine in just 20 years. And this playbook can be used with other constitutional ambiguities.</p>

            <p>For example, there are already emerging theories about Congress's power to refuse to count electoral votes, about when federal courts can override state election procedures, and about executive power during election emergencies. Each follows the same pattern: find ambiguity, develop aggressive interpretation, normalize, deploy.</p>

            <h2>Bottom Line: What This Means for Democracy Defenders</h2>

            <p>The ISL theory's near-success teaches us something crucial about election subversion in the modern era: it's increasingly legalistic. Rather than stuffing ballot boxes or intimidating voters directly, sophisticated actors look for constitutional ambiguities they can exploit through litigation and judicial capture.</p>

            <p>This means several things for anyone working on democracy protection:</p>

            <p><strong>State courts are now critical infrastructure.</strong> Since Moore v. Harper preserved state court review, these courts are a key check on legislative overreach. But <a href="https://boltsmag.org/state-supreme-court-elections-2024/">Bolts Magazine reporting</a> shows that many Americans don't even know their state supreme court justices are elected. Supporting nonpartisan court reform and voter education about judicial elections is crucial.</p>

            <p><strong>Legal theories need early pushback.</strong> By the time ISL reached the Supreme Court, it had been normalized through years of conservative legal movement infrastructure. Tracking and countering fringe theories before they become mainstream matters. Organizations like the <a href="https://www.votingrightslab.org/">Voting Rights Lab</a> do this work but need more support.</p>

            <p><strong>Federal judicial appointments remain pivotal.</strong> ISL failed 6-3, but it could easily have gone 5-4 the other way with different Justices. The composition of federal courts, including the Supreme Court, directly determines which election subversion theories succeed or fail.</p>

            <p><strong>Documentation beats prophylactic rules.</strong> One reason ISL failed is that there's 200+ years of history showing state courts reviewing election laws. The Court couldn't ignore this historical practice. Creating clear records now—of how elections work, what normal processes look like, what constitutes interference—will matter in future litigation.</p>

            <p>If you're looking for a project in this space, consider supporting state-level judicial reform organizations or helping track emerging legal theories in election law. The <a href="https://healthyelections.org/">Stanford-MIT Healthy Elections Project</a> is doing excellent work on election administration that could benefit from volunteer researchers tracking legal developments.</p>

            <p>The ISL theory lost this round. But the legal warfare over constitutional ambiguities in election law is just beginning. Understanding these theories, how they develop, and how they're deployed is essential for anyone who wants to protect democratic processes in 2026, 2028, and beyond.</p>
