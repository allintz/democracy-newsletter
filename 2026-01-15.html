            <h2>The Fake Electors Scheme: How It Actually Worked</h2>

            <p><strong>Reading time: 5 minutes</strong></p>

            <p>If you've been following election integrity issues, you've probably heard the phrase "fake electors" thrown around. But what does that actually mean? How did the scheme work, who was involved, and why does it matter for future elections?</p>

            <p>Today we're doing a deep dive into one of the most organized attempts to subvert the 2020 election—and why understanding its mechanics matters if you're thinking about democracy projects.</p>

            <h2>What Are Electors, Anyway?</h2>

            <p>Let's start with the basics, because the Electoral College is genuinely confusing.</p>

            <p>When you vote for president, you're not technically voting for the candidate directly. You're voting for a slate of electors pledged to that candidate. After Election Day, these electors meet in their state capitals in December to cast the official votes that actually choose the president.</p>

            <p>This happens in every state, on the same day (the second Wednesday in December), in a process that's usually ceremonial. The real electors—the ones chosen based on who won the popular vote in each state—meet, cast their votes, and send certificates to Congress.</p>

            <p>Here's the key part: Congress counts those electoral votes on January 6th. For the count to proceed smoothly, Congress needs to know which certificates are legitimate.</p>

            <h2>The Scheme: Creating Alternative Slates</h2>

            <p>In 2020, the Trump campaign and its allies created alternative slates of electors in seven states Biden won: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.</p>

            <p>These weren't real electors in any legal sense. Biden had won these states, so the Democratic electors were the legitimate ones. But the fake electors met anyway, filled out official-looking certificates, and sent them to Congress and the National Archives.</p>

            <p>According to a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/20/politics/trump-campaign-officials-rudy-giuliani-fake-electors/index.html">detailed CNN investigation</a>, 84 people participated in these fake elector meetings across the seven states. The scheme was coordinated—many of the certificates used nearly identical language.</p>

            <p>Why go through this elaborate charade?</p>

            <h2>The Strategy Behind the Certificates</h2>

            <p>The fake elector scheme served multiple potential purposes, and it's worth understanding each one because they reveal different vulnerabilities in our system.</p>

            <p><strong>Strategy 1: Create confusion on January 6th.</strong> If Congress received two sets of electoral certificates from the same state—one from real electors, one from fake ones—maybe Vice President Pence could claim there was a "dispute" that required resolution. Perhaps he could reject both sets, or send the matter back to state legislatures, or simply refuse to count Biden's electors.</p>

            <p>This connects directly to the Eastman memos we covered earlier this week. The fake certificates would give Pence a pretext to execute Eastman's plan.</p>

            <p><strong>Strategy 2: Buy time for legal challenges.</strong> Some of the fake elector certificates included language saying they were "conditional" on ongoing court cases. As detailed in <a href="https://www.michigan.gov/ag/-/media/Project/Websites/AG/releases/2023/07/18/Gilchrist_Charges_071823.pdf">court filings from the Michigan Attorney General</a>, organizers told some participants the certificates were just a "procedural safeguard" in case legal challenges succeeded.</p>

            <p>The idea: if a court somehow overturned Biden's win after the real electors met but before January 6th, the fake certificates could be swapped in.</p>

            <p><strong>Strategy 3: Provide political cover.</strong> Even if the scheme didn't succeed legally, it could muddy the waters enough to make the whole process look disputed and questionable to the public.</p>

            <h2>How Organized Was This?</h2>

            <p>Very organized. And we know this because of subsequent investigations and criminal cases.</p>

            <p>According to the <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-J6-REPORT/pdf/GPO-J6-REPORT.pdf">January 6th Committee's final report</a>, Trump campaign officials, including lawyers and state-level coordinators, actively organized these fake elector meetings. Kenneth Chesebro, a Trump campaign lawyer, wrote detailed memos explaining the strategy.</p>

            <p>The timeline matters here. The first fake elector meeting was planned in early December 2020. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/15/politics/kenneth-chesebro-texts-fake-electors/index.html">Text messages obtained by CNN</a> show Chesebro coordinating the creation of these slates across multiple states, with full knowledge that Biden had won.</p>

            <p>In Michigan, for example, the fake electors met at the state Republican Party headquarters on December 14, 2020. They signed certificates claiming to be "the duly elected and qualified Electors for President and Vice President of the United States of America from the State of Michigan."</p>

            <p>This was false. They weren't duly elected. Biden won Michigan by 154,000 votes, <a href="https://www.michigan.gov/sos/elections/election-results/2020-election-results">as certified by the Michigan Board of State Canvassers</a>.</p>

            <p>The fake Michigan electors even tried to enter the state capitol to make their certificates look more official, but security turned them away because they had no legal standing to be there.</p>

            <h2>Why Did This Ultimately Fail?</h2>

            <p>The scheme failed at multiple chokepoints, and understanding these failures helps us see where our system held—and where it's vulnerable.</p>

            <p><strong>Chokepoint 1: Mike Pence refused to cooperate.</strong> Despite enormous pressure, Pence wouldn't go along with rejecting or ignoring the real electoral certificates. As documented in his testimony to the <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-J6-REPORT/pdf/GPO-J6-REPORT.pdf">January 6th Committee</a>, he consulted with advisors who told him clearly that he lacked the constitutional authority to do what Trump was asking.</p>

            <p>This was crucial. The entire scheme needed Pence's participation to have any chance of working.</p>

            <p><strong>Chokepoint 2: State officials stood firm.</strong> In every one of these seven states, the actual state officials responsible for certification—secretaries of state, governors, election boards—refused to treat the fake electors as legitimate. They sent only the real certificates to Congress.</p>

            <p><strong>Chokepoint 3: Congress ultimately counted only real electors.</strong> Even after the January 6th violence, when Congress reconvened that night, they counted only the legitimate electoral votes.</p>

            <h2>The Legal Consequences</h2>

            <p>Here's where this gets real: people are facing criminal charges for this.</p>

            <p>In Michigan, <a href="https://www.michigan.gov/ag/-/media/Project/Websites/AG/releases/2023/07/18/Gilchrist_Charges_071823.pdf">16 fake electors were charged</a> with forgery and other crimes by the state Attorney General in 2023. Several took plea deals in 2024 in exchange for testifying against others.</p>

            <p>In Georgia, the fake elector scheme is a major part of the RICO case brought by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis. As detailed in the <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23916689-read-the-indictment-of-former-president-donald-trump-in-georgia">charging documents</a>, the fake electors are treated as part of a broader conspiracy to overturn the election.</p>

            <p>Similar charges were filed in Nevada and Arizona. Federal cases are also ongoing.</p>

            <p>The legal theory is straightforward: these people created false official documents and tried to pass them off as legitimate government records. That's a crime.</p>

            <h2>Why This Matters for Future Elections</h2>

            <p>Understanding the fake electors scheme isn't just about relitigating 2020. It reveals specific vulnerabilities in how we choose presidents.</p>

            <p><strong>Vulnerability 1: The system depends on individual integrity.</strong> Mike Pence had the power to create chaos, even if he couldn't unilaterally change the outcome. A more compliant vice president could do significant damage. (The Electoral Count Reform Act of 2022 reduced this vulnerability by clarifying that the VP's role is purely ministerial, but determined actors could still test these boundaries.)</p>

            <p><strong>Vulnerability 2: The Electoral College creates specific attack surfaces.</strong> Because the presidency is decided by 538 electors rather than the popular vote, you only need to flip a few states to change the outcome. This makes targeted schemes like fake electors more feasible than trying to manipulate millions of individual votes.</p>

            <p><strong>Vulnerability 3: State-level coordination points are crucial.</strong> The scheme failed partly because secretaries of state and governors in these states held firm. But these are elected (or appointed) positions. If election deniers control these offices in 2028, similar schemes might succeed.</p>

            <p>This isn't hypothetical. After 2020, candidates who questioned the election results ran for secretary of state positions in multiple swing states in 2022. <a href="https://statesuniteddemocracy.org/resources/the-election-denier-report-card/">According to reporting from States United Democracy Center</a>, most lost their races, but the strategy was clear: gain control of the certification process itself.</p>

            <h2>The Bottom Line for Democracy Builders</h2>

            <p>If you're thinking about starting projects in the democracy space, the fake electors scheme teaches several lessons:</p>

            <p><strong>Institutional knowledge matters desperately.</strong> Many of the officials who stopped this scheme knew what they were legally required to do and had the backbone to do it. Training programs for election officials, especially in swing states, could be high-impact.</p>

            <p><strong>State-level races for secretary of state and attorney general are critical.</strong> These offices turned out to be key defensive positions. Supporting quality candidates for these positions—or creating scorecards and voter education around these down-ballot races—could prevent future subversion attempts.</p>

            <p><strong>Documentation and transparency helped here.</strong> We know so much about the fake electors scheme because of texts, emails, and testimony that came out through investigations. Projects that increase transparency in election administration or preserve digital evidence could be valuable.</p>

            <p><strong>The legal system worked slowly but ultimately worked.</strong> The people who participated in this scheme are facing real consequences, which creates deterrence. Supporting efforts to maintain prosecutorial independence and capacity in state AG offices matters.</p>

            <p><strong>Existing organization worth knowing about:</strong> <a href="https://statesuniteddemocracy.org/">States United Democracy Center</a> tracks election-related threats and provides legal support to state officials. They've been directly involved in defending against election subversion attempts and might be worth connecting with if you're exploring this space.</p>

            <p>The fake electors weren't a failed coup attempt that came close to succeeding. But they were a serious, coordinated effort to exploit ambiguities in our electoral process—and they revealed that in a different scenario, with different people in key positions, things could have gone very differently.</p>

            <p>That's what makes understanding these mechanics so important. Not to catastrophize, but to know exactly where our system held, where it's vulnerable, and where focused work could make a difference.</p>
