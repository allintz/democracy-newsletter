            <h1>The Alabama VRA Case and the "State Legislature Veto" Pattern: When Legislatures Override Election Safeguards</h1>

            <p><strong>Epistemic status:</strong> High confidence on the historical facts and court rulings; medium confidence on predictions about future applications of this tactic.</p>

            <p>Today I want to walk you through a specific mechanism of election subversion that doesn't get enough attention: state legislatures passing laws that directly override or weaken existing election safeguards, then using those new laws to justify interference in election administration.</p>

            <p>This isn't theoretical. It's happened multiple times in US history, and understanding this pattern is crucial for anyone thinking about protecting democracy in 2026 and 2028.</p>

            <h2>The Basic Pattern</h2>

            <p>Here's how it works:</p>

            <p>A state has existing election procedures—maybe they're in the state constitution, maybe they're established by decades of practice, maybe they're required by federal law. These procedures create guardrails: nonpartisan election administration, bipartisan certification boards, clear deadlines, judicial review.</p>

            <p>Then the state legislature, controlled by one party, passes a new law that weakens or eliminates those guardrails. The law might give the legislature itself more direct power over elections. It might strip authority from election officials. It might create new requirements that make voting harder or certification easier to block.</p>

            <p>When someone challenges the law, the legislature argues: "We're just exercising our constitutional authority over elections. Courts shouldn't interfere with the democratic process."</p>

            <p>This is dangerous because it wraps election subversion in the language of legislative authority.</p>

            <h2>Case Study: Alabama and the Voting Rights Act (2023-2024)</h2>

            <p>Let me show you a recent, clear example that illustrates both the tactic and how institutions can (sometimes) push back.</p>

            <p>In 2023, the Supreme Court ruled in <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/21-1086_2co3.pdf">Allen v. Milligan</a> that Alabama's congressional district map violated the Voting Rights Act. The state had drawn only one majority-Black district despite Black voters comprising 27% of the population. The Court, in a 5-4 decision, said Alabama needed to draw a second district where Black voters could elect their preferred candidates.</p>

            <p>Alabama's response was striking. Instead of complying with the Court's order, the Republican-controlled legislature passed a new map that made only minimal changes—still containing just one majority-Black district. According to <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/alabama-defying-supreme-court-redistricting">reporting by the Brennan Center</a>, the legislature essentially argued that they had complied "enough" and that the Court couldn't force them to draw a second majority-Black district if they believed their new map was legal.</p>

            <p>This was a direct test of whether a state legislature could simply override a federal court order about election procedures.</p>

            <p>What happened next is important: in September 2023, a three-judge federal panel <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/09/05/1197703656/alabama-redistricting-congressional-map-voting-rights">rejected Alabama's new map</a> and ordered the state to adopt a remedial map with two majority-Black districts. The court said Alabama had "substantially defied" the Supreme Court's mandate. Alabama eventually complied under court order in October 2023, according to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/10/03/1203318129/alabama-redistricting-congressional-map">NPR reporting</a>.</p>

            <p>But notice the pattern: Legislature passes map → Court strikes it down → Legislature passes essentially the same map again → Court has to intervene again → Legislature only complies under direct federal court supervision.</p>

            <h2>Why This Matters: The 2021 Georgia Election Law</h2>

            <p>Now let's look at a more directly election-administration-focused example: Georgia's SB 202, passed in March 2021.</p>

            <p>This 98-page law made numerous changes to Georgia's election procedures, but several provisions followed the "legislative override" pattern I'm describing. According to the <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/georgias-sb-202">Brennan Center's detailed analysis</a>, key provisions included:</p>

            <p><strong>The State Election Board takeover provision:</strong> The law removed the Georgia Secretary of State as chair of the State Election Board and allowed the legislature-controlled board to take over county election boards if they were deemed to be performing poorly. As <a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/civil-liberties/georgias-sb-202-is-a-frontal-attack-on-voting-rights">documented by voting rights organizations</a>, this created a mechanism for state-level interference in local election administration.</p>

            <p><strong>New restrictions on line warming:</strong> The law criminalized providing food or water to voters waiting in line, which <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/03/25/981357583/what-you-need-to-know-about-georgias-new-voting-restrictions">NPR reported</a> could particularly affect precincts with long wait times—often in urban, minority-heavy areas.</p>

            <p><strong>Shortened runoff periods:</strong> The law reduced the runoff period from nine weeks to four weeks, which election administrators said would make it much harder to process and count absentee ballots, according to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/georgia-gop-passes-major-elections-bill-limiting-ballot-access-n1262028">NBC News analysis</a>.</p>

            <p>The legislature's argument? They were responding to concerns about election integrity and exercising their constitutional authority to regulate elections.</p>

            <p>But notice what this actually did: It took power away from existing election administrators (the Secretary of State, county boards) and gave it to the legislature-controlled State Election Board. It created new opportunities for the state to intervene in local election administration.</p>

            <p>This is the pattern: using legislative authority to weaken the independence of election administration.</p>

            <h2>The Historical Precedent: Reconstruction and After</h2>

            <p>This tactic isn't new. The clearest historical precedent is what happened after Reconstruction ended in 1877.</p>

            <p>During Reconstruction, federal troops and federal oversight ensured that Black citizens in the South could vote. Many Southern states had Black voters as a majority or near-majority of the electorate. According to <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2947903">historian Eric Foner's research</a>, by 1867-1868, Black voter registration in many Southern states exceeded white registration.</p>

            <p>But after federal troops withdrew, Southern state legislatures systematically passed laws to disenfranchise Black voters. These weren't called "we're taking away Black people's right to vote" laws. They were called "election integrity" measures: literacy tests, poll taxes, grandfather clauses, white primaries.</p>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.blackpast.org/african-american-history/mississippi-plan-1890/">Mississippi Plan of 1890</a> is the template. The state held a constitutional convention specifically to "eliminate the negro from politics," as convention delegates openly stated. But the methods were formally race-neutral: a poll tax, a literacy test, a requirement to interpret the state constitution.</p>

            <p>As historian <a href="https://uncpress.org/book/9780807855256/struggle-for-mastery/">Michael Perman documents</a>, these laws were explicitly designed to look neutral while having discriminatory effects. And they worked: Black voter registration in Mississippi fell from over 90% during Reconstruction to less than 6% by 1892.</p>

            <p>The lesson: legislatures used their formal authority over election procedures to systematically exclude voters, and it took federal intervention (the Voting Rights Act of 1965) to undo it—nearly a century later.</p>

            <h2>Why Courts Sometimes Can't (or Don't) Stop This</h2>

            <p>You might be thinking: "But can't courts just strike down these laws?"</p>

            <p>Sometimes yes, sometimes no. Here's why it's complicated:</p>

            <p><strong>State legislatures do have legitimate authority over elections.</strong> The US Constitution's <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artI-S4-C1-1/ALDE_00001056/">Elections Clause</a> says "The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections...shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof." So legislatures aren't making up their authority—they actually have it.</p>

            <p><strong>Courts apply different levels of scrutiny to different types of laws.</strong> Laws that directly discriminate based on race get "strict scrutiny"—they're almost always struck down. But laws that have discriminatory effects but aren't explicitly discriminatory get weaker review. The Supreme Court's <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-96_6k47.pdf">2013 decision in Shelby County v. Holder</a> gutted the Voting Rights Act's preclearance requirement, making it much harder to challenge these laws before they take effect.</p>

            <p><strong>Courts are often reluctant to second-guess legislative judgments about election administration.</strong> The legal doctrine of "legislative deference" means courts generally assume legislatures are acting in good faith unless there's clear evidence of discriminatory intent.</p>

            <p><strong>Litigation takes time.</strong> Even if a law eventually gets struck down, it might be in effect for one or more election cycles. The Alabama redistricting case took over a year to resolve. That's enough time for the law to affect real elections.</p>

            <h2>The 2022 Arizona Near-Miss</h2>

            <p>Let me give you one more recent example that shows how close we came to this pattern playing out in 2022.</p>

            <p>In Cochise County, Arizona, two Republican county supervisors initially refused to certify the November 2022 election results by the state's legal deadline. According to <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/11/28/cochise-county-arizona-canvass-election-results-deadline/69686204007/">Arizona Republic reporting</a>, they claimed they wanted more information about the certification of vote-counting equipment, despite the county's election having no reported irregularities.</p>

            <p>This created a legal crisis: if Cochise County didn't certify, would Arizona's statewide results (including close races for Governor and Attorney General) be affected?</p>

            <p>The state responded with a lawsuit, and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/dec/02/cochise-county-arizona-certify-election-results">a judge ordered the supervisors to certify</a>. They finally did, but only under court order and after missing the statutory deadline.</p>

            <p>Now here's the scary part: Arizona Republicans had already proposed legislation that would have given the state legislature more power to intervene in election certification if counties claimed irregularities. The <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/legislature/2021/05/27/arizona-audit-motivates-more-election-bills/7454272002/">2021 proposal</a> didn't pass, but the logic was exactly the pattern I'm describing: legislature creates a law that gives itself authority to override election officials.</p>

            <p>If such a law had been in place in 2022, the Cochise County supervisors' refusal could have triggered legislative intervention. In a state where the Governor's race was decided by just 17,000 votes out of 2.6 million cast, that could have changed the outcome.</p>

            <h2>Bottom Line: What This Means for Democracy Protection</h2>

            <p>The "legislative override" pattern is particularly dangerous because it exploits the legitimate authority that state legislatures have over elections. It's hard to combat because it looks like normal legislative activity rather than obvious subversion.</p>

            <p><strong>For 2026 and 2028, watch for:</strong></p>

            <li><strong>State-level legislation that shifts power over election administration from independent officials to legislature-controlled bodies.</strong> Georgia's SB 202 is the template.</li>

            <li><strong>Laws that create new grounds for legislative intervention in certification or recounts.</strong> These create chokepoints where close elections can be disputed.</li>

            <li><strong>"Election integrity" laws that make administration more complex or create more ambiguity.</strong> Complexity creates opportunities for challenges and disputes.</li>

            <li><strong>Attempts to restrict or eliminate judicial review of election procedures.</strong> If courts can't review legislative actions, there's no check on legislative overreach.</li>

            <p><strong>The key vulnerability:</strong> Unlike some of the mechanisms we've discussed in previous newsletters (like county officials refusing to certify), this pattern is harder to defend against because it uses the formal legal process. You can't just point to one bad actor—you need to challenge a law that an entire legislature passed.</p>

            <p><strong>Project idea for democracy defenders:</strong> We need real-time monitoring and rapid-response legal capacity for state legislation affecting election administration. Organizations like the <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/issues/defend-our-elections">Brennan Center</a> and <a href="https://protectdemocracy.org/">Protect Democracy</a> do this work, but they're outnumbered. A network of state-based legal groups that can quickly analyze, challenge, and publicize problematic election legislation would be incredibly valuable.</p>

            <p>The good news is that institutions can push back when they're willing to act. The Alabama redistricting case shows that federal courts will intervene when state legislatures clearly violate the law. But it requires vigilance, quick legal action, and sustained pressure.</p>

            <p>The pattern is clear. The question is whether we'll recognize it quickly enough when it appears again.</p>
