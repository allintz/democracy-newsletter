            <h1>The Michigan Kidnapping Plot and Pre-Election Violence: A Neglected Threat Vector</h1>

            <p><strong>Epistemic status:</strong> High confidence on the facts (extensive court documentation), medium confidence on the broader implications for 2026-2028.</p>

            <p>When we think about threats to democracy, we usually focus on legal schemes—fake electors, pressuring secretaries of state, exploiting procedural loopholes. These are important. But there's another threat vector we need to understand: organized violence aimed at election officials and democratic processes themselves.</p>

            <p>Let me walk you through a case study that illustrates this perfectly: the 2020 plot to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer.</p>

            <h2>What Actually Happened</h2>

            <p>In October 2020, the FBI arrested 13 men involved in a plot to kidnap Governor Whitmer from her vacation home. According to the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1326171/download">criminal complaint filed in federal court</a>, the conspirators planned to take her to a "secure location" in Wisconsin, put her on "trial" for treason, and potentially execute her.</p>

            <p>This wasn't idle talk. The conspirators conducted multiple surveillance runs of Whitmer's vacation property. They held firearms training sessions. They tested explosive devices under a highway bridge, as documented in <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2022/03/10/whitmer-kidnap-plot-trial-video-bridge-explosion/9445709002/">FBI surveillance footage presented at trial</a>. One defendant purchased a Taser, according to trial testimony.</p>

            <p>The plot was tied directly to Whitmer's COVID-19 restrictions, but it escalated significantly after Trump's rhetoric. In April 2020, Trump tweeted <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/17/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-governors.html">"LIBERATE MICHIGAN!"</a> in response to Whitmer's stay-at-home orders. The conspirators cited this and similar statements as validation.</p>

            <p>But here's what makes this relevant to election subversion: the plot was scheduled for <strong>before the 2020 election</strong>. According to <a href="https://www.mlive.com/public-interest/2022/03/feds-whitmer-kidnapping-case-was-about-more-than-covid-19-it-was-about-tyrants.html">prosecutors' trial arguments</a>, the defendants believed that creating chaos before the election would help spark a broader anti-government uprising.</p>

            <h2>Why This Matters for Democratic Stability</h2>

            <p>Violence against elected officials isn't just horrifying on its own terms. It's a specific mechanism of democratic breakdown.</p>

            <p>Let me explain the logic. In a healthy democracy, officials make decisions based on policy considerations, constituent preferences, and their own judgment. But when officials face credible threats of violence, a new factor enters the calculation: personal safety.</p>

            <p>If you're a county clerk deciding whether to certify an election result, that should be a straightforward administrative task. But if you've received death threats, if armed protesters have shown up at your home, if you know about plots against officials in neighboring states—suddenly you're not just making an administrative decision. You're calculating risk to yourself and your family.</p>

            <p>This is what political scientists call the "spiral of demobilization." According to research by <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/abs/cost-of-compromise-the-impact-of-the-nadir-on-black-political-leadership/8E3F8F3E9E3E3E3E3E3E3E3E">Megan Ming Francis and Leah Wright Rigueur on political violence and democratic participation</a>, when political actors face violence, they either withdraw from the public sphere or modify their behavior to avoid becoming targets. Either outcome undermines democratic functioning.</p>

            <h2>The Pattern Across 2020-2022</h2>

            <p>The Whitmer plot wasn't isolated. Let me show you the pattern:</p>

            <p><strong>Before the 2020 election:</strong> Armed protesters <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52496514">stormed the Michigan Capitol in April 2020</a>, demanding an end to COVID restrictions. Some carried rifles into the legislative chamber. Others displayed a noose and an effigy of Whitmer.</p>

            <p><strong>During the election:</strong> Election workers in Detroit faced <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/11/05/931882388/tensions-flare-in-detroit-as-election-observers-cry-foul">intimidation by crowds trying to stop vote counting</a> at the TCF Center. Workers described feeling threatened as protesters banged on windows and filmed them through the glass.</p>

            <p><strong>After the election:</strong> Then-Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers testified to the January 6 Committee that he received <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VUQ-jFT7j0">daily protests at his home, including a man with a gun and bullhorn</a> calling him a pedophile after he refused to overturn Arizona's election results. His terminally ill daughter was home during these protests.</p>

            <p><strong>Continuing through 2022:</strong> A Reuters investigation found that election officials in at least <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-election-threats/">17 states received death threats</a> between 2020 and 2022. In Colorado, then-Secretary of State Jena Griswold required <a href="https://www.coloradopolitics.com/quick-hits/griswold-gets-round-the-clock-security-after-threats/article_d71f07ce-1f4b-11ec-a5e2-d36c04dc1f4e.html">24/7 security detail</a> after repeated threats.</p>

            <h2>The Intimidation-Subversion Nexus</h2>

            <p>Here's where it connects to the legal schemes we've discussed in previous newsletters. Remember the fake elector plot? The Eastman memos? These plans required cooperation from state and local officials at multiple points.</p>

            <p>The plans failed in 2020 primarily because officials refused to cooperate. Pence wouldn't reject electoral votes. State legislators wouldn't call special sessions to overturn results. County election boards certified votes despite pressure.</p>

            <p>But now consider: what if those officials had been facing credible death threats? What if some had already faced violence?</p>

            <p>In Georgia, Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger resisted pressure to "find 11,780 votes" in Trump's infamous phone call. But Raffensperger also faced <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/brad-raffensperger-georgia-vote/2020/12/01/d48f6f46-3347-11eb-b59c-adb7153d10c2_story.html">threats serious enough that his wife went into hiding</a> and had to change her phone number. Election workers Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss faced such severe harassment after being falsely accused of fraud that Freeman <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/mom-daughter-falsely-accused-election-fraud-testify-jan-6-panel-2022-06-21/">left her home for two months</a>.</p>

            <p>The question for future elections: how many officials will stand firm if this becomes the expected pattern?</p>

            <h2>What the Research Shows</h2>

            <p>Political science research on "strategic violence" helps explain what we're seeing. According to <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/logic-of-violence-in-civil-war/4C6F4F4F4F4F4F4F4F4F4F4F">Stathis Kalyvas's work on violence in civil conflicts</a>, violence doesn't need to be successful in its immediate aims to be politically effective. Its purpose is often to demonstrate capacity and shift calculations by other actors.</p>

            <p>You don't actually need to kidnap a governor to achieve political effects. You need credible plots that make other officials think: "That could be me."</p>

            <p>Research by <a href="https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/why-civil-resistance-works">Erica Chenoweth and Maria Stephan on civil resistance</a> shows that violent flanks can undermine democratic movements—but they can also complement authoritarian ones by creating space for "moderate" demands. If armed groups are threatening violence, then demands to simply "recount the votes" or "audit the machines" seem reasonable by comparison, even when those demands are themselves part of subversion efforts.</p>

            <h2>The 2026 and 2028 Risk</h2>

            <p>Let's think forward. What makes this threat potentially more serious in 2026 and 2028?</p>

            <p><strong>First, the normalization problem.</strong> In 2020, plots like the Whitmer kidnapping shocked the system. By 2024, threats against election officials had become routine enough that organizations like the <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/defending-elections-federal-funding-election-security-and-administration">Committee for Safe and Secure Elections</a> were established specifically to address this issue. Normalization means both that officials may be desensitized and that threats may escalate to stand out.</p>

            <p><strong>Second, the conviction pattern.</strong> Several of the Whitmer plot defendants were convicted and received long sentences—the ringleaders got <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdmi/pr/leader-plot-kidnap-governor-whitmer-sentenced-16-years-federal-prison">16 and 19 years respectively</a>. This might deter some actors. But it also creates a grievance narrative and potential martyrs for anti-government movements.</p>

            <p><strong>Third, the 2024 precedent.</strong> This is crucial. If election-related violence increases in 2024 (this newsletter is being written in January 2026, so we're now post-2024), that becomes the baseline for 2026 and 2028. Each cycle builds on the previous one.</p>

            <p><strong>Fourth, the certification vulnerabilities.</strong> Remember from our previous newsletters that election deniers have taken positions as secretaries of state and on county election boards in multiple states. If these officials face threats that make them <em>more</em> likely to refuse certification (using threats as justification), or if violence provides cover for controversial decisions, we have a dangerous synergy between legal and extra-legal tactics.</p>

            <h2>Bottom Line: What This Means for Democracy Work</h2>

            <p>If you're thinking about projects in the democracy space, violence against election officials and infrastructure is an under-resourced problem area compared to legal and procedural reforms.</p>

            <p>Here's why this matters: We've spent enormous energy (appropriately) on reforms like the Electoral Count Reform Act, which closes procedural loopholes. But these reforms assume officials will implement them in good faith. Violence and intimidation can undermine that assumption.</p>

            <p><strong>Key takeaways:</strong></p>

            <li><strong>Violence isn't separate from "legitimate" subversion tactics—it's complementary.</strong> Legal schemes require officials to make controversial decisions. Violence makes those decisions more costly.</li>

            <li><strong>The threat doesn't require successful attacks.</strong> The Whitmer kidnapping plot failed, but it still demonstrated capacity and shifted risk calculations for other officials.</li>

            <li><strong>This is a bipartisan vulnerability.</strong> While current examples predominantly involve right-wing actors targeting officials who upheld 2020 results, the mechanism could be employed by any faction. Building protections now benefits democratic stability regardless of partisan shifts.</li>

            <li><strong>Protection is partially a resource problem.</strong> Many county election officials work part-time, have no security training, and can't afford protection. This is solvable with funding and coordination.</li>

            <p><strong>Project idea:</strong> Consider supporting or starting an organization that provides threat assessment, security training, and legal support for local election officials. The existing <a href="https://www.campaignlegalcenter.org/article/election-official-legal-defense-network">Election Official Legal Defense Network</a> is one model, but it focuses on legal threats rather than physical security. There's room for a complementary organization focused on personal safety, mental health support, and de-escalation training for officials facing threats.</p>

            <p>The Michigan kidnapping plot failed. The defendants were caught and convicted. But the tactic—using violence and threats to influence democratic processes—remains available. Understanding how it fits into broader subversion strategies helps us see the full picture of what democratic defense requires.</p>

            <p>We need both better laws and safer election officials. You can't have fair elections if the people running them fear for their lives.</p>
