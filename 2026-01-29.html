            <h1>Understanding the "Independent State Legislature Theory": Why a Fringe Legal Argument Nearly Changed American Democracy</h1>

            <p><strong>Epistemic status:</strong> High confidence on the legal history and Supreme Court decisions; moderate confidence on predicting how similar arguments might be deployed in future elections.</p>

            <p>Hey there,</p>

            <p>Today we're diving into one of the most consequential legal theories you've probably never heard of: the Independent State Legislature (ISL) theory. This matters because in 2022, four Supreme Court justices signaled they might support a constitutional interpretation that would have fundamentally restructured how American elections work—and versions of this argument will almost certainly resurface before 2028.</p>

            <p>Let me explain what this is, why it's dangerous, and why it's not quite dead yet.</p>

            <h2>What is the Independent State Legislature Theory?</h2>

            <p>The ISL theory starts with a real clause in the Constitution. Article I, Section 4 says: "The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof."</p>

            <p>Similar language appears in Article II for presidential elections. Seems straightforward, right?</p>

            <p>Here's where it gets wild. ISL proponents argued that "Legislature" means <em>only</em> the state legislature—not the entire state lawmaking system. Under this interpretation, state constitutions couldn't constrain how legislatures run elections. State courts couldn't review election laws. Governors couldn't veto them. Independent redistricting commissions would be unconstitutional.</p>

            <p>The legislature would have nearly unchecked power over federal elections.</p>

            <h2>Why This Matters: The 2020 Context</h2>

            <p>This wasn't just academic theorizing. After the 2020 election, Trump's legal team explicitly invoked ISL theory in their attempt to overturn results.</p>

            <p>The argument went like this: Pennsylvania's Supreme Court had extended the mail ballot deadline by three days due to COVID-19 (citing the state constitution's free and equal elections clause). According to <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/20/20-845/163492/20201220144634807_20-845%20Pennsylvania%20Reply%20Brief.pdf">Trump's legal filings to the U.S. Supreme Court</a>, this violated the U.S. Constitution because only the legislature could set election rules.</p>

            <p>If the Supreme Court had accepted this argument, Pennsylvania's election results could have been thrown into chaos. But more importantly, it would have established a precedent: state legislatures could override their own state courts, governors, and constitutions when running federal elections.</p>

            <p>Think about what that enables. A legislature controlled by Party X could pass election rules favorable to Party X. The state's governor (Party Y) couldn't veto it. The state supreme court (interpreting the state constitution) couldn't strike it down. Voter-created independent redistricting commissions would be powerless.</p>

            <h2>How Close Did This Come to Succeeding?</h2>

            <p>Closer than most people realize.</p>

            <p>In 2022, the Supreme Court agreed to hear <em>Moore v. Harper</em>, a case directly testing ISL theory. The case involved North Carolina's congressional maps, which the state supreme court had struck down as illegal partisan gerrymanders under the state constitution.</p>

            <p>North Carolina's legislature argued their maps were unreviewable by state courts under ISL theory. According to <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/moore-v-harper-explained">analysis by the Brennan Center for Justice</a>, at least four justices had previously expressed openness to some version of ISL theory, meaning the case could potentially reshape American democracy with just one more vote.</p>

            <p>Here's what made legal scholars nervous: In a 2020 case about Pennsylvania's mail ballot deadline, Chief Justice Roberts wrote that the Supreme Court had "repeatedly" emphasized that state courts changing election rules creates "free-floating" concerns. And in Bush v. Gore (2000), the Court had suggested Florida's Supreme Court might have overstepped by interpreting state election law.</p>

            <p>These weren't full endorsements of ISL theory, but they pointed in that direction.</p>

            <h2>The Good News: Moore v. Harper Rejected ISL Theory</h2>

            <p>In June 2023, the Supreme Court <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/21-1271_3f14.pdf">ruled 6-3 against the strongest version of ISL theory</a>. Chief Justice Roberts wrote that state courts do have the power to review legislature-drawn maps under state constitutions.</p>

            <p>But—and this is crucial—the Court didn't completely close the door. Roberts wrote that federal courts can still review whether state courts have gone "too far" in interpreting their own state constitutions when it comes to federal elections.</p>

            <p>What does "too far" mean? The Court didn't really say. This is what lawyers call a "standard" rather than a "rule"—it's squishy and depends on future case-by-case determinations.</p>

            <h2>Why This Still Matters for 2026 and 2028</h2>

            <p>Even though the strongest version of ISL theory lost, the argument infrastructure remains intact. Here's why you should still care:</p>

            <p><strong>First, the "too far" loophole is exploitable.</strong> In a close 2028 election, imagine this scenario: A battleground state's supreme court makes a ruling about ballot counting (maybe extending a deadline due to a hurricane, or clarifying an ambiguous signature-matching rule). The losing side appeals to federal court arguing the state court went "too far." Now you've got federal judges—potentially including Supreme Court justices—deciding whether to override a state court's interpretation of its own state constitution.</p>

            <p>This is a recipe for chaos in close elections. According to <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-law-and-politics/article/identifying-and-minimizing-the-risk-of-election-subversion-and-stolen-elections-in-the-contemporary-united-states/AA14DA3DC82C875FA0F7E1BF0F8DE58F">election law scholar Rick Hasen's analysis</a>, the vague "too far" standard creates significant uncertainty that could be weaponized.</p>

            <p><strong>Second, state legislatures now know the argument has some Supreme Court support.</strong> Even though ISL theory ultimately lost 6-3, three justices (Thomas, Alito, and Gorsuch) dissented, endorsing a stronger version of legislative power. That's not nothing. It tells state legislatures that pushing the boundaries might find a receptive audience, especially if Court composition changes.</p>

            <p><strong>Third, legislatures have already started acting on ISL-adjacent theories.</strong> After 2020, several Republican-controlled state legislatures passed laws asserting more control over election administration—often justified with language echoing ISL theory about legislative primacy. <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/breaking-down-georgias-new-voting-law/BZKMXLQ7BRFH3KPMIAX3HEL344/">Georgia's SB 202</a> (which we've discussed before) and <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/01/18/arizona-legislature-proposes-election-procedures-oversight-committee/6559028001/">Arizona's attempts to assert legislative control over the Secretary of State's authority</a> both cited legislative authority over elections as justification.</p>

            <h2>The Deeper Pattern: Constitutional Clauses as Wedges</h2>

            <p>Here's what fascinates me about ISL theory: It shows how ambiguous constitutional language can be weaponized.</p>

            <p>The "Legislature" in Article I and II really does refer to something. The question is whether it means "the legislature operating within the state's entire constitutional system" or "the legislature as a free-standing sovereign entity for federal elections only."</p>

            <p>For over 200 years, everyone assumed the first interpretation. Then suddenly, under pressure of wanting to change election outcomes, the second interpretation emerged as plausible to significant legal voices.</p>

            <p>This pattern appears elsewhere too. The word "may" in Electoral Count Act provisions (like "the governor <em>may</em> certify results") could be read as obligatory or discretionary. The phrase "dispute or contest" in certification rules could mean anything from clear fraud to any allegation whatsoever.</p>

            <p>Constitutional law professor <a href="https://electionlaw.osu.edu/research/projects/independent-state-legislature-theory">Ned Foley has written extensively</a> about how these textual ambiguities become dangerous when combined with strong partisan incentives and close elections. His point: The Constitution has always contained these ambiguities, but they didn't matter much when political actors had shared commitment to norms. When that commitment erodes, suddenly every "may" and "shall" becomes contested terrain.</p>

            <h2>What Could Happen Next?</h2>

            <p>Let's think through some scenarios for 2026 and 2028:</p>

            <p><strong>Scenario 1: The "too far" challenge.</strong> A battleground state's supreme court (say, Wisconsin or Pennsylvania) makes an election administration ruling that affects ballot counting. The losing presidential campaign immediately appeals to federal court, arguing the state court exceeded its authority under Moore v. Harper. The case reaches the Supreme Court in December 2028. Now SCOTUS must decide whether to override a state supreme court's interpretation of its own constitution—in an election decided by thousands of votes.</p>

            <p><strong>Scenario 2: Legislative override attempts.</strong> A state legislature doesn't like how its Secretary of State (elected statewide, different party) is planning to administer the 2028 election. The legislature passes a law claiming exclusive authority over federal election administration, citing Article I, Section 4. The Secretary of State sues, arguing this violates the state constitution. The case ultimately asks: How much can legislatures insulate their election rules from state-level checks and balances?</p>

            <p><strong>Scenario 3: The independent commission challenge.</strong> Several states use independent redistricting commissions created by voter initiative (Arizona, California, Michigan, Colorado). A legislature sues to reclaim redistricting power, arguing that these commissions—while valid under state law—violate the U.S. Constitution's assignment of redistricting to "the Legislature." We've been here before (<a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/13-1314_kjfl.pdf">Arizona State Legislature v. Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission</a>, 2015, where SCOTUS upheld commissions 5-4), but Court composition has changed.</p>

            <p>None of these scenarios are guaranteed. But Moore v. Harper showed that ISL-adjacent arguments have support on the Supreme Court, and the "too far" language creates an opening for future challenges.</p>

            <h2>Bottom Line: Key Takeaways for Democracy Defenders</h2>

            <p><strong>Why this matters:</strong> ISL theory represents a category of threat that's particularly hard to counter—it operates through constitutional interpretation rather than norm-breaking, making it look like a legitimate legal dispute rather than election subversion.</p>

            <p><strong>For 2026 and 2028:</strong> Watch for challenges to state court rulings on election administration, especially in battleground states. The "too far" standard from Moore v. Harper creates an opening for federal court intervention in close elections.</p>

            <p><strong>The meta-lesson:</strong> Ambiguous constitutional text becomes dangerous when combined with strong partisan incentives and close elections. This isn't just about ISL theory—it's about how any textual uncertainty can be exploited.</p>

            <p><strong>Project idea:</strong> If you're looking for impactful work, there's a real need for resources that help state court judges understand how their rulings might be challenged under Moore v. Harper's "too far" standard. Organizations like the <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/">Brennan Center for Justice</a> and the <a href="https://healthyelections.org/">Election Law Program at Stanford-MIT Healthy Elections Project</a> are doing some of this work, but there's room for more—especially resources aimed at state-level judges, court clerks, and attorneys general offices. These actors need to understand how to write opinions that are resilient to federal court challenge while still protecting voting rights under state constitutions.</p>

            <p>The silver lining? ISL theory failed at the Supreme Court despite significant support. American institutions bent but didn't break. That's worth remembering. But the "too far" caveat means we haven't seen the last of this argument.</p>
