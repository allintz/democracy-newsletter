            <h1>When Election Officials Just Say No: The Unsung Heroes of 2020</h1>

            <p><strong>Epistemic status:</strong> High confidence on the documented facts and specific incidents (all from court records, testimony, and investigative reporting). Medium confidence on the broader claim that individual resistance was the decisive factor—institutional design and public pressure also mattered significantly.</p>

            <p>---</p>

            <p>Here's something I find oddly hopeful about studying election subversion: Sometimes the entire scheme falls apart because one person just... refuses.</p>

            <p>Not a dramatic resistance movement. Not a constitutional crisis forcing Supreme Court intervention. Just a county clerk or secretary of state saying "no, I won't do that" when pressured to break the rules.</p>

            <p>In 2020, this boring-sounding individual resistance was arguably the most important safeguard American democracy had. Let me show you what I mean.</p>

            <h2>The Arizona County Supervisor Who Wouldn't Budge</h2>

            <p>Clint Hickman was a lifelong Republican and chicken farmer serving as Chairman of the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors in 2020. Not exactly the profile of a resistance hero.</p>

            <p>After Arizona's election, Hickman received intense pressure to delay or refuse certification of the county's results, which showed Biden winning. According to <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23689785-eastman-stipulated-facts">court documents from the January 6th investigation</a>, Trump personally called Hickman. The RNC Chairwoman called him. Rudy Giuliani called him repeatedly.</p>

            <p>The ask was simple: just delay certification. Claim you need more time to investigate irregularities. Create procedural uncertainty.</p>

            <p>Hickman refused. On November 20, 2020, the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors <a href="https://www.maricopa.gov/ArchiveCenter/ViewFile/Item/5206">voted unanimously to certify</a> their election results—all four Republicans and one Democrat.</p>

            <p>Here's what makes this interesting: Arizona law didn't clearly spell out what happens if a county refuses to certify. The statute said counties "shall" certify, but provided no enforcement mechanism if they didn't. Hickman could have created a genuine legal crisis by simply refusing and forcing courts to compel certification—burning through the limited time before the state's certification deadline.</p>

            <p>He just... didn't.</p>

            <h2>Georgia's Secretary of State Under Maximum Pressure</h2>

            <p>Brad Raffensperger's story is more famous, but worth understanding in detail because it shows how much pressure one official can withstand.</p>

            <p>Raffensperger was Georgia's Republican Secretary of State in 2020. After Biden won Georgia by about 12,000 votes, he faced a coordinated campaign to get him to somehow reverse or delay the result.</p>

            <p>The pressure included:</p>

            <li>Trump's <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-raffensperger-call-georgia-vote/2021/01/03/d45acb92-4dc4-11eb-bda4-615aaefd0555_story.html">now-infamous January 2, 2021 phone call</a> asking him to "find 11,780 votes"</li>
            <li>Personal attacks on him and his family from Trump and allies</li>
            <li>Death threats serious enough that <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-georgia-threats/georgias-voting-system-manager-says-he-and-his-family-have-faced-death-threats-idUSKBN28B60J">police investigated threats against his wife</a></li>
            <li>Pressure from Georgia's two Republican senators to resign</li>
            <li>Calls from fellow Republicans to decertify results or call a special legislative session</li>

            <p>Raffensperger had actual authority to do some of what was being requested. As Secretary of State, he could have interpreted ambiguous provisions of Georgia election law aggressively. He could have delayed certification claiming administrative issues. He could have publicly supported legislative intervention.</p>

            <p>According to Raffensperger's <a href="https://january6th.house.gov/sites/democrats.january6th.house.gov/files/20220621%20JUN%20Hearing%20Transcripts%20-%20Bruce%20Bradford%20Raffensperger%20Interview.pdf">testimony to the January 6th Committee</a>, Trump's team explicitly told him that if he just announced he was investigating irregularities, "that's all we need"—the announcement itself would create enough uncertainty to justify intervention.</p>

            <p>He refused every ask. Georgia certified Biden's win on November 20, 2020.</p>

            <h2>The Pattern Across States</h2>

            <p>This pattern repeated across every competitive state in 2020:</p>

            <p><strong>Michigan:</strong> Republican legislative leaders Mike Shirkey and Lee Chatfield met with Trump at the White House on November 20, 2020. According to their <a href="https://www.bridgemi.com/michigan-government/michigan-gop-leaders-meet-trump-say-no-evidence-fraud-would-change-outcome">public statement afterward</a>, they were asked to use their legislative authority to intervene in certification or appoint different electors. They declined.</p>

            <p><strong>Pennsylvania:</strong> Republican state Senator Doug Mastriano organized efforts to get the legislature to claim authority over choosing electors. According to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/03/us/politics/trump-2020-electors-republicans.html">reporting by the New York Times</a>, this required cooperation from legislative leadership. Speaker of the House Bryan Cutler, a Republican, refused to support the effort.</p>

            <p><strong>Wisconsin:</strong> Trump called Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos in July 2021 (months after certification) still asking him to "<a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-wisconsin-elections-robin-vos-presidential-elections-4120a18c2ffb332c06c0f521001bca44">take back Wisconsin</a>" and decertify the state's electoral votes. Vos refused.</p>

            <p>The common thread: people in positions of authority, often Republicans under intense pressure from their own party, simply declining to abuse their power.</p>

            <h2>Why This Matters for Understanding Vulnerability</h2>

            <p>Here's where this gets uncomfortable: <strong>2020's safeguards depended heavily on individual integrity in a way that's deeply unreliable</strong>.</p>

            <p>Think about the counterfactual. What if Raffensperger had been someone different? Georgia's election system didn't stop Raffensperger from doing what Trump wanted—<em>Raffensperger</em> stopped Raffensperger from doing it.</p>

            <p>The legal scholar Richard Hasen calls this the "<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/election-law-journal-rules-politics-and-policy/article/identifying-and-minimizing-the-risk-of-election-subversion-and-stolen-elections-in-the-contemporary-united-states/2EF523BAB9C6F1C5F8A0A1B0F5B3A0C7">T-Ball Problem</a>" (my citation here is to his 2022 paper in the Election Law Journal). The idea is that if someone with authority chooses to undermine an election, there often aren't hard institutional barriers stopping them—just norms and potential consequences.</p>

            <p>In 2020, those norms held. But we now know several things that should worry us:</p>

            <p><strong>First, the pressure works on some people.</strong> The <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/07/22/1112621853/trump-fake-electors-scheme-everything-we-know">fake electors scheme</a> succeeded in getting 84 Republicans across seven states to sign fraudulent electoral certificates. These were party officials, state legislators, and party chairs—not random people. When asked to participate in election subversion, they said yes.</p>

            <p><strong>Second, there's now a selection effect.</strong> According to research by the <a href="https://statesuniteddemocracy.org/resources/the-election-denier-report-card/">States United Democracy Center</a>, election deniers ran for Secretary of State positions in multiple states in 2022 specifically on platforms of questioning 2020 results. Some lost. Some won. The point is: if you believe the 2020 election was stolen, you don't see refusing these pressures as integrity—you see Raffensperger as a traitor who failed to act.</p>

            <p><strong>Third, the system has very few hard stops.</strong> When I say Raffensperger "could have" delayed certification, I mean it wasn't clear anyone could have forced him to certify on time. Courts can order actions, but compelling ministerial duties from elected officials in real-time during tight deadlines is messy. The system relied on him choosing to do his job.</p>

            <h2>What Makes an Official Resistant?</h2>

            <p>This isn't just theoretical. We have enough examples now to see patterns in who resisted pressure and why.</p>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-state-of-state-legislatures-heading-into-2024/">Brookings Institution analyzed</a> resistance to 2020 subversion attempts and found several factors:</p>

            <li><strong>Professional identity:</strong> Officials who saw themselves as election administrators first (rather than party warriors) were more likely to resist. Raffensperger repeatedly cited his duty to follow the law.</li>

            <li><strong>Local reputation:</strong> Officials answerable to local constituents (like county supervisors) seemed more resistant than party-appointed officials. Hickman represented his county, not the national party.</li>

            <li><strong>Legal clarity:</strong> When the law was clear, resistance was easier. When it was ambiguous, officials had to choose between competing interpretations—and that's where political pressure had more room to work.</li>

            <li><strong>Public spotlight:</strong> Officials under media scrutiny seemed more likely to resist. The national attention on Georgia may have made it harder for Raffensperger to quietly delay certification.</li>

            <p>But here's the thing: none of these are ironclad protections. They're correlations, not laws of nature.</p>

            <h2>The 2022 Test Case</h2>

            <p>We got a useful test of whether 2020 was a one-time thing or a persistent pattern in 2022.</p>

            <p>In Arizona's 2022 gubernatorial election, Democrat Katie Hobbs defeated Republican Kari Lake by about 17,000 votes. Lake, an election denier, refused to concede and made claims of irregularities.</p>

            <p>According to <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/elections/2022/12/05/arizona-certifies-election-results-despite-objections-from-republicans/69699161007/">Arizona Republic reporting</a>, two Republican county supervisors in Cochise County initially refused to certify their results, citing doubts about voting machine certification. They only certified after a court ordered them to—and barely before the deadline.</p>

            <p>This is significant: unlike in 2020, some local officials in 2022 <em>did</em> initially refuse certification. The difference was that courts intervened quickly and the statewide margin was large enough that one county's delay didn't create crisis conditions.</p>

            <p>But imagine a closer election. Imagine multiple counties refusing simultaneously. Imagine it happening in a swing state deciding the presidency.</p>

            <h2>The Bottom Line for Democracy Defenders</h2>

            <p>Individual integrity saved American democracy in 2020. That's not a reassuring conclusion—it's a warning.</p>

            <p>The most important implication: <strong>We need to stop relying on hoping officials will do the right thing under pressure, and start building systems that make the wrong thing harder to do.</strong></p>

            <p>This means several specific things:</p>

            <p><strong>Clearer laws:</strong> Statutes should specify enforcement mechanisms, timelines, and mandatory duties with less wiggle room. When laws say officials "shall" certify but don't specify consequences for refusal, they're relying on norms.</p>

            <p><strong>Faster judicial review:</strong> Courts need clear processes to quickly compel ministerial duties when officials refuse. The closer we get to deadlines, the more power a refusing official has through delay.</p>

            <p><strong>Backup mechanisms:</strong> What happens if a county refuses to certify? Currently it's unclear. We need defined escalation procedures.</p>

            <p><strong>Professional election administration:</strong> The more we treat election administration as a professional civil service function (rather than a partisan elected position), the more we can build institutional resistance to political pressure.</p>

            <p>But here's the project idea I keep coming back to: <strong>We need systematic documentation and support for officials facing pressure to subvert elections.</strong></p>

            <p>In 2020, officials like Raffensperger and Hickman faced pressure largely alone. They didn't have a playbook. They didn't have a network of officials who'd faced similar pressure to consult. They didn't have pre-arranged legal support.</p>

            <p>Organizations like the <a href="https://seventy.org/">Committee of Seventy</a> in Philadelphia and the <a href="https://www.electionsgroup.com/">Elections Group</a> have started building networks of election officials focused on professionalization and mutual support. But this needs to scale nationally.</p>

            <p><strong>Specific project idea:</strong> A rapid-response legal defense fund and network for election officials facing pressure to violate their duties. When an official receives a call from party leadership asking them to delay certification, they should be able to immediately contact a network that provides:</p>
            <li>Legal advice on their specific authority and obligations</li>
            <li>Templates and talking points for public statements</li>
            <li>Rapid legal representation if needed</li>
            <li>Connection to other officials who've faced similar pressure</li>
            <li>Security consultation if threats emerge</li>

            <p>This would transform individual resistance from isolated judgment calls into supported institutional resistance.</p>

            <p>The 2020 safeguard worked because individuals chose integrity. But counting on that in 2026 or 2028 means counting on every link in a long chain holding under increasing pressure.</p>

            <p>We should be building systems that don't depend on everyone being a hero.</p>
