            <h1>Daily Democracy Newsletter</h1>

            <p>---</p>

            <h2>Why Georgia's 2021 Election Interference Case Should Terrify You (And It's Not About What You Think)</h2>

            <p><strong>Epistemic status:</strong> High confidence. This newsletter discusses well-documented events with extensive primary source evidence, though some legal interpretations remain contested.</p>

            <p>When most people think about threats to democracy in 2020-2022, they picture the January 6th attack or fake electors. But there's a less-discussed incident that reveals something arguably more dangerous: the discovery that a small group of determined actors can gain direct physical access to voting systems, and we might not catch them for months.</p>

            <p>Let me tell you about Coffee County, Georgia.</p>

            <h3>What Actually Happened in Coffee County</h3>

            <p>Coffee County is a small, rural county in southern Georgia with about 43,000 residents. It went heavily for Trump in 2020.</p>

            <p>On January 7, 2021—one day after the Capitol attack—a team of outsiders gained access to Coffee County's election office. According to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2022/08/06/trump-allies-copied-georgia-voter-data/">court filings and surveillance footage analyzed by The Washington Post</a>, these weren't election officials. They were forensic data specialists hired by Sidney Powell's legal team, along with at least one employee from SullivanStrickler, a firm working on Trump's election challenges.</p>

            <p>These individuals spent hours copying sensitive election data. We're talking about everything: ballot images, vote totals, and critically, the complete software from Dominion voting machines used throughout the county.</p>

            <p>The local elections supervisor, Misty Hampton, appears to have granted them access. According to <a href="https://www.ajc.com/politics/emails-reveal-coffee-county-election-files-shared-with-trump-team/">emails obtained by Atlanta Journal-Constitution</a>, she coordinated with Powell's team to facilitate the visit.</p>

            <h3>Why This Matters More Than You Think</h3>

            <p>Here's the scary part: This wasn't discovered immediately through security protocols or monitoring systems. </p>

            <p>The breach only became public knowledge more than a year later, in 2022, when news organizations started investigating the broader fake electors scheme. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/18/us/politics/trump-indictment-coffee-county-georgia.html">Surveillance video and forensic analysis</a> eventually showed what happened, but there was no real-time alert system that caught this.</p>

            <p>Think about what this means. A small team gained complete access to voting system software—the kind of access that could theoretically allow someone to understand vulnerabilities, test exploits, or plan future attacks. And nobody noticed for over a year.</p>

            <h3>The Broader Pattern: Small Counties, Big Vulnerabilities</h3>

            <p>Coffee County wasn't an isolated incident of outsiders gaining access to election systems.</p>

            <p>In Colorado, Mesa County Clerk Tina Peters allowed unauthorized individuals to access voting equipment during a software update in May 2021. According to <a href="https://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/newsRoom/pressReleases/2021/PR20210810MesaCounty.html">Colorado Secretary of State's office investigation</a>, she turned off security cameras and brought in people who made copies of hard drives. Peters was eventually <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2024/08/12/tina-peters-guilty-verdict-mesa-county/">convicted on seven felony counts</a> related to this breach in 2024.</p>

            <p>In Michigan, several counties experienced similar situations. <a href="https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2021/06/01/michigan-gop-attorney-seized-voting-machine-after-november-election/7491701002/">Reporting by The Detroit News</a> documented how voting machine data from Roscommon County ended up with pro-Trump attorneys who were investigating unfounded fraud claims.</p>

            <p>What connects these cases? They all involve small, often rural counties where election administration might be handled by a few people, security resources are limited, and a single sympathetic local official can grant access to entire systems.</p>

            <h3>The Security Architecture Problem</h3>

            <p>To understand why this vulnerability is so serious, you need to understand how election security is supposed to work in the United States.</p>

            <p>The fundamental principle is "defense in depth." Voting systems are supposed to be isolated from the internet. Access is supposed to be strictly controlled and logged. Physical security, background checks, and chain of custody procedures create multiple layers of protection.</p>

            <p>But here's the thing: This architecture assumes that the biggest threat is external hackers or foreign adversaries trying to break in.</p>

            <p>Coffee County revealed a different threat model: What happens when local officials with legitimate access invite outsiders in?</p>

            <p>All those security layers—the air gaps, the access logs, the physical barriers—become irrelevant when someone with a key decides to open the door. As <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/2023-08/2023.08.28%20-%20Halderman%20Expert%20Report.pdf">election security expert J. Alex Halderman testified</a> in a 2023 Georgia lawsuit, the Coffee County breach gave unauthorized parties "complete and unfettered access" to a voting system that's used in multiple states.</p>

            <h3>What Could Someone Actually Do With This Access?</h3>

            <p>I want to be careful here not to overstate the risk or fuel conspiracy theories. Let me be clear about what we know and what we don't.</p>

            <p><strong>What we know for certain:</strong> The individuals in Coffee County obtained complete copies of Dominion voting system software. This software is used in counties across multiple states.</p>

            <p><strong>What experts say is theoretically possible:</strong> According to <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/2023-08/2023.08.28%20-%20Halderman%20Expert%20Report.pdf">Halderman's analysis</a>, having this level of access would allow someone to study the software, look for vulnerabilities, and potentially develop exploits. Think of it like having the complete source code for a security system—you could study it to figure out how to defeat it.</p>

            <p><strong>What we don't have evidence of:</strong> Any indication that voting systems were successfully manipulated or that election results were changed. The investigations have focused on unauthorized access and data theft, not vote tampering.</p>

            <p>But here's the crucial point: We now know that determined actors were willing to commit crimes to gain this access. The question for future elections isn't just "can systems be breached?" but "will insiders grant access to people who want to breach them?"</p>

            <h3>The Scalability Question</h3>

            <p>Coffee County has about 43,000 residents. It had maybe 5-10 election officials handling operations on a given day.</p>

            <p>According to the <a href="https://www.eac.gov/research-and-data/datasets-codebooks-and-surveys">U.S. Election Assistance Commission</a>, there are roughly 10,000 election jurisdictions in the United States. Many are small counties similar to Coffee County.</p>

            <p>Do the math: If you wanted to cause chaos or gain access to voting systems in 2026 or 2028, you don't need to compromise huge, well-resourced jurisdictions like Los Angeles County or Maricopa County. Those places have professional staff, significant security budgets, and high visibility.</p>

            <p>You need sympathetic officials in maybe 20-30 small counties in swing states. Counties where the entire election operation might depend on 3-4 people, where the supervisor might be an elected partisan official, and where a breach might not be discovered for months.</p>

            <p>This is depressingly scalable.</p>

            <h3>What About Safeguards and Detection?</h3>

            <p>After Coffee County and similar incidents became public, you might think there would be robust new monitoring systems to detect unauthorized access to election systems.</p>

            <p>The reality is more complicated.</p>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/election-security">Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)</a> has increased resources for election security and offers services to state and local jurisdictions. Many states have improved their security protocols.</p>

            <p>But here's the fundamental problem: Most election security measures focus on technical vulnerabilities—network security, software patches, penetration testing. These are important, but they don't address the insider threat problem very well.</p>

            <p>If a county clerk decides to let someone into the office and give them access to systems, standard cybersecurity tools might not flag this as suspicious. It looks like normal authorized access from the perspective of the system.</p>

            <p>Some states have implemented better auditing and monitoring. But according to <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/election-officials-under-attack">research from the Brennan Center for Justice</a>, many small jurisdictions still lack resources for comprehensive security programs.</p>

            <h3>The Legal Response Has Been... Okay?</h3>

            <p>So what happened to the people involved in Coffee County?</p>

            <p>Misty Hampton, the Coffee County elections supervisor, was <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/08/14/1193753628/trump-georgia-indictment-full-list">indicted by Fulton County DA Fani Willis</a> as part of the broader election interference case. She faces charges related to conspiracy and computer crimes.</p>

            <p>Sidney Powell, whose team organized the breach, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/sidney-powell-plea-deal-georgia-election-1c6c79569d6f15c33c9e0bca9c4e5d7b">pleaded guilty</a> in October 2023 to reduced charges and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors.</p>

            <p>Several other individuals involved in gaining access to systems in Georgia and other states have faced charges or are under investigation.</p>

            <p>This is good—there should be consequences for breaching election systems. But here's what worries me: These prosecutions only happened because the Coffee County breach was connected to the high-profile Trump investigation.</p>

            <p>What about the next Coffee County? If similar unauthorized access happens in 2026 or 2028, will it be detected quickly? Will there be the political will and resources to investigate and prosecute in jurisdictions where the local DA might be sympathetic to the officials who granted access?</p>

            <h3>The Deeper Problem: Trusted Insiders</h3>

            <p>There's a concept in security called the "trusted insider problem." It's much harder to defend against people who are supposed to have access than against external attackers.</p>

            <p>In most organizations, you address this through redundancy, oversight, and separation of duties. No single person has complete access. Actions are logged and reviewed. Multiple people need to sign off on sensitive operations.</p>

            <p>But many county election offices don't have the staffing or resources for this level of oversight. According to <a href="https://democracyfund.org/idea/election-administration-at-the-local-level/">research from the Democracy Fund</a>, the median election jurisdiction in the U.S. is quite small, and many rely on part-time staff or officials with limited training.</p>

            <p>When your entire operation is 3-4 people, and one of them is an elected official who believes the election was stolen, separation of duties becomes difficult.</p>

            <h3>What's Different About This Vulnerability</h3>

            <p>We've covered several election subversion vulnerabilities in previous newsletters—certification delays, the contingent election mechanism, the Independent State Legislature theory. </p>

            <p>Here's what makes the physical access problem different and particularly worrying:</p>

            <p><strong>1. It's mostly invisible.</strong> When county officials refuse to certify, it makes news. When state legislators try novel legal theories, there are public hearings. When someone copies voting system software in the middle of the night, nobody notices for a year.</p>

            <p><strong>2. It could undermine all other safeguards.</strong> Post-election audits and recounts assume that voting systems themselves are trustworthy. If bad actors gain the ability to manipulate systems (or even just create the appearance that systems could have been manipulated), they can cast doubt on any results.</p>

            <p><strong>3. It's hard to prove a negative.</strong> Even if no votes were changed, once unauthorized parties have accessed systems, how do you prove the systems are still trustworthy? This creates opportunities for bad-faith actors to claim elections are compromised.</p>

            <p><strong>4. The defense requires resources many jurisdictions lack.</strong> Protecting against insider threats requires money, personnel, training, and robust oversight. Small counties often have none of these.</p>

            <h3>What Could Actually Help</h3>

            <p>I'm going to be honest: This is a hard problem to solve. But here are some approaches that could help:</p>

            <p><strong>Physical security requirements with teeth:</strong> <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/7344">Legislation like the SAFE Act</a>, introduced in Congress, would set baseline security standards for election infrastructure. But these need to be specific enough to prevent unauthorized access and funded enough that small jurisdictions can actually implement them.</p>

            <p><strong>Real-time monitoring and alerts:</strong> Several cybersecurity firms and nonprofits are working on systems that would flag unusual access patterns to voting systems. The challenge is deploying this to thousands of small jurisdictions and ensuring alerts are actually reviewed.</p>

            <p><strong>Redundancy and oversight for small counties:</strong> Some states have begun creating regional election centers or requiring that small counties partner with larger jurisdictions for certain security-sensitive operations. This could provide backup when a single local official goes rogue.</p>

            <p><strong>Better forensic capabilities:</strong> After Coffee County, we learned how difficult it is to reconstruct what happened when someone gains unauthorized access. Improved logging, forensic tools, and incident response capabilities would help.</p>

            <p><strong>Professionalization of election administration:</strong> Many states are moving toward models where election administrators are appointed professionals rather than elected partisans. This doesn't eliminate all risk, but it reduces the likelihood of officials who view their role as advancing a party's interests rather than administering elections.</p>

            <h3>A Project Idea Worth Considering</h3>

            <p>If you're thinking about starting a project in this space, here's one gap I see: <strong>A rapid-response forensic team for election security incidents.</strong></p>

            <p>Imagine a nonprofit that maintains a team of cybersecurity experts, lawyers, and election administration specialists who can be deployed within 24 hours when there's a suspected breach or unauthorized access to election systems. They would:</p>

            <li>Conduct immediate forensic analysis</li>
            <li>Document evidence for potential prosecution  </li>
            <li>Advise local officials on incident response</li>
            <li>Communicate clearly with the public about what happened and what it means</li>
            <li>Work with state authorities to ensure appropriate follow-up</li>

            <p>This team would need to be genuinely nonpartisan and technically excellent to have credibility across the political spectrum. It would need rapid-response funding so they could deploy immediately.</p>

            <p>Organizations like the <a href="https://www.eac.gov/">Election Assistance Commission</a> and <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/">CISA</a> provide resources, but they're federal agencies with limitations on how quickly they can respond to local incidents. A nimble nonprofit could fill this gap.</p>

            <p>The model could be similar to election observation missions, but focused specifically on technical security incidents rather than general election monitoring.</p>

            <h3>Bottom Line: Key Takeaways for Democracy Builders</h3>

            <p><strong>The Coffee County breach revealed a structural vulnerability:</strong> Small counties with limited resources and elected partisan officials can grant outsiders complete access to voting systems, and we might not discover the breach for months.</p>

            <p><strong>This threat model is different from what most election security focuses on.</strong> Instead of external hackers trying to break in, we're dealing with trusted insiders opening the door. Traditional cybersecurity measures don't address this well.</p>

            <p><strong>The vulnerability is scalable.</strong> With thousands of small election jurisdictions, bad actors don't need to compromise many places to cause chaos or gain access to widely-used voting systems.</p>

            <p><strong>For anyone building in the democracy space, this suggests a few priorities:</strong></p>

            <li><strong>Physical security and access controls</strong> need much more attention than they currently get</li>
            <li><strong>Rapid detection and response</strong> capabilities are crucial—we can't wait a year to discover breaches</li>
            <li><strong>Small jurisdictions need support</strong>—they're both the most vulnerable and least resourced</li>
            <li><strong>Insider threat mitigation</strong> should be a central part of election security, not an afterthought</li>

            <p>The 2026 midterms are coming up fast. If I were trying to subvert an election in 2026 or 2028, the Coffee County playbook would be very attractive: Find sympathetic officials in strategic small counties, gain access to systems, and either manipulate outcomes or create enough doubt about system integrity to justify rejecting results.</p>

            <p>The question is whether we'll build the defenses and monitoring capabilities to prevent this before the next attempt.</p>

            <p>---</p>
