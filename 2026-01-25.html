            <h1>The Michigan Kidnapping Plot and Violence Against Election Officials: A New Pressure Point</h1>

            <p><strong>Epistemic status:</strong> High confidence on documented facts and criminal cases; moderate confidence on causal mechanisms and future projections. This topic involves both completed legal proceedings and ongoing societal trends that are harder to measure.</p>

            <p><strong>Reading time:</strong> ~5 minutes</p>

            <p>Here's a question I've been thinking about: What happens when the threats against election officials stop being just angry emails and start involving actual kidnapping plots?</p>

            <p>Most discussions about election subversion focus on legal schemes—fake electors, certification delays, lawsuit strategies. But there's another mechanism that's gotten less systematic attention: making the job of election official so dangerous that good people quit, and only true believers willing to bend rules stay.</p>

            <p>Let me walk you through a case study that crystallizes this threat, then explain why it matters for 2026 and 2028.</p>

            <h2>The Michigan Plot You Might Have Forgotten About</h2>

            <p>In October 2020, the FBI arrested 13 men for plotting to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer. According to the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1326171/download">criminal complaint filed in federal court</a>, the conspirators conducted surveillance of her vacation home, planned to abduct her before the election, and discussed putting her on "trial" for treason.</p>

            <p>The plot wasn't just angry talk. As <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1326171/download">detailed in the FBI affidavit</a>, the group conducted firearms training, built improvised explosive devices for testing, and surveilled Whitmer's property multiple times. They discussed whether to take her by boat or by vehicle. They debated whether to blow up a bridge to delay police response.</p>

            <p>Several conspirators were <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/man-gets-16-years-prison-plot-kidnap-michigan-governor-2022-12-27/">convicted in federal court</a> with sentences ranging from 6 to 16 years. This wasn't aspirational fantasy—it was operational planning stopped just before execution.</p>

            <p>Now here's the part that doesn't get enough attention: Whitmer wasn't targeted randomly. She was targeted specifically because of her COVID-19 policies and her role in certifying Michigan's 2020 election results. The conspirators viewed her as an enemy of "the people" who needed to be removed.</p>

            <h2>The Broader Pattern: Threats as Infrastructure</h2>

            <p>The Michigan case was extreme, but it sits at the end of a spectrum that includes thousands of less dramatic incidents.</p>

            <p>A <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/election-officials-under-attack">2022 survey by the Brennan Center for Justice</a> found that one in three election officials feels unsafe because of their job. Specifically, 54% said they were concerned about the safety of their colleagues, and 17% reported receiving threats.</p>

            <p>Think about that number for a second. Nearly one in five election workers—people who do unglamorous administrative work for modest pay—received actual threats.</p>

            <p>The consequences are predictable. According to <a href="https://www.reed.edu/political-science/voter-threats.html">research by Reed College political scientists</a>, roughly one in five local election officials left their jobs between 2020 and 2022. Many cited safety concerns as a primary factor.</p>

            <p>Here's why this matters strategically: elections aren't run by "the government" as some monolithic entity. They're run by thousands of county clerks, registrars, and board members. Most serve small jurisdictions. Most aren't lawyers. Many are part-time or volunteers.</p>

            <p>When you threaten these people systematically, you don't need to convince all of them to subvert elections. You just need to convince enough of them to quit.</p>

            <h2>The Replacement Pipeline Problem</h2>

            <p>When experienced election officials leave, who replaces them?</p>

            <p>In many cases, according to <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/election-officials-threats-quit-replacements">reporting by ProPublica and Votebeat</a>, the replacements are either:</p>

            <li>Less experienced administrators who don't know the complex rules as well</li>
            <li>Partisan activists specifically motivated to "fix" perceived election problems</li>

            <p>Neither is ideal, but the second category is where the real risk lives.</p>

            <p>Consider Tina Peters, the former Mesa County, Colorado clerk who <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/09/politics/tina-peters-indicted-colorado/index.html">allowed unauthorized individuals to access voting equipment</a> in 2021. She wasn't a long-time professional—she was relatively new to the role and deeply convinced that the 2020 election had been stolen. She was <a href="https://apnews.com/article/tina-peters-sentencing-colorado-election-e4ed5e19e3b9c4b80d2f3a1f3f0c5b9e">convicted in 2024</a> and sentenced to 9 years in prison.</p>

            <p>Or consider Shasta County, California, where election deniers won control of the county board in 2022 and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/15/us/shasta-county-california-voter-fraud.html">promptly fired the longtime elections clerk</a>, replacing her with someone more aligned with their views about election security.</p>

            <p>The pattern isn't universal, but it's real: create enough pressure on mainstream election officials, and some jurisdictions will replace them with people willing to take more "creative" approaches to election administration.</p>

            <h2>Why This Mechanism Is Different</h2>

            <p>Compare this to other subversion tactics we've discussed:</p>

            <li><strong>Fake electors</strong> require coordination across multiple states and legal cover</li>
            <li><strong>Certification delays</strong> require officials willing to break clear rules in public</li>
            <li><strong>Lawsuit strategies</strong> require plausible legal theories and cooperative judges</li>

            <p><strong>Threatening election workers</strong> requires only decentralized action by angry citizens, most of whom won't face legal consequences.</p>

            <p>That's what makes it scalable and hard to counter. The Michigan kidnapping plot failed, but most threats are just threatening phone calls or social media harassment. Law enforcement can't prosecute thousands of angry emails. Social media platforms can't moderate every local election conspiracy theory.</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, the cumulative effect—officials quitting, being replaced by partisans, growing afraid to make professional judgments that might trigger backlash—creates systemic vulnerability.</p>

            <h2>The 2026/2028 Trajectory</h2>

            <p>Here's what worries me looking ahead:</p>

            <p>First, we're in a midpoint, not an endpoint. The 2020 election subversion attempts failed, but they've seeded a narrative among many Republicans that elections are fundamentally compromised. <a href="https://www.umass.edu/news/article/umass-amherst-poll-finds-majority-republicans-still-believe-2020-election-was-stolen">Polling by the University of Massachusetts Amherst</a> found that as of late 2023, roughly 60% of Republicans still believed the 2020 election was stolen.</p>

            <p>That's not just survey noise—that's tens of millions of people who view election officials as potential enemies rather than neutral administrators.</p>

            <p>Second, the institutional response has been scattered. Some states have <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/election-worker-safety">enhanced legal protections for election workers</a>, but many haven't. Some counties have improved security, but thousands haven't had the resources.</p>

            <p>Third, we're heading into 2026 midterms with this vulnerability unaddressed. Close House or Senate races in just a few counties could determine control of Congress. Local election officials in those counties will be under enormous scrutiny—and potentially enormous pressure.</p>

            <h2>Bottom Line: What This Means for Democracy Projects</h2>

            <p>If you're thinking about starting a project in the democracy space, here's what this analysis suggests:</p>

            <p><strong>The threat isn't just legal schemes</strong>—it's the systematic intimidation of the human beings who administer elections. This creates both short-term risks (officials making decisions based on fear rather than rules) and long-term risks (experienced professionals being replaced by partisans).</p>

            <p><strong>The leverage point is local support infrastructure.</strong> Election officials need:</p>
            <li>Legal defense funds when threatened</li>
            <li>Security training and resources</li>
            <li>Professional networks to reduce isolation</li>
            <li>Clear legal backing from state authorities</li>
            <li>Public recognition that their work matters</li>

            <p><strong>Existing organizations working on this:</strong> The <a href="https://www.securingdemocracy.org/committees-safe-secure-elections/">Committee for Safe and Secure Elections</a> provides resources and support. The <a href="https://democracydocket.com/opinion/protecting-those-who-protect-our-elections/">Election Official Legal Defense Network</a> offers legal assistance. These are good models, but they need more resources and broader reach.</p>

            <p><strong>Project idea:</strong> A "rapid response" network that provides immediate security assessments and legal support when local election officials face threats. Think of it as a 24-hour hotline plus on-call security consultants who can help officials determine whether a threat is credible and what steps to take. Most county clerks don't have access to this kind of expertise, and many make decisions (like quitting) without ever getting professional risk assessments.</p>

            <p>The Michigan kidnapping plot failed because the FBI infiltrated it early. But we can't rely on law enforcement to catch every threat before it escalates. We need to make the ecosystem around election officials resilient enough that threats don't drive out good people or create opportunities for bad actors.</p>

            <p>That's not a legal fix or a policy reform. It's infrastructure—boring, unglamorous infrastructure that keeps democracy working at the county level where it actually happens.</p>
