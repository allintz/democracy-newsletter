            <h1>The Eastman Memos: How 2020's Subversion Plan Exploited Ambiguity in the Electoral Count Act</h1>

            <p><strong>Epistemic status:</strong> High confidence on documented facts and legal interpretations; the counterfactual questions about what would have happened remain genuinely uncertain.</p>

            <p>Let's talk about how close we came to a constitutional crisis in January 2021—not through violence, but through paperwork.</p>

            <p>If you want to understand election subversion threats, you need to understand the Eastman memos. These weren't fringe conspiracy theories. They were legal memoranda written by a former Supreme Court clerk, outlining a step-by-step plan for Vice President Pence to overturn the 2020 election. And they exploited real ambiguities in how America counts electoral votes.</p>

            <h2>What Were the Eastman Memos?</h2>

            <p>In December 2020 and January 2021, lawyer John Eastman wrote several memos for President Trump's team. According to documents obtained by the <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-J6-REPORT/pdf/GPO-J6-REPORT.pdf">January 6th Committee</a>, these memos laid out a plan for Vice President Pence to refuse to count electoral votes from certain states on January 6th, 2021.</p>

            <p>The basic argument went like this:</p>

            <li>Seven states (Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin) had sent "competing slates" of electors—one from the certified winner (Biden) and one from Trump supporters claiming fraud.</li>

            <li>The Vice President, as President of the Senate, has the authority to decide which electoral votes to count.</li>

            <li>Pence should either reject the Biden electors from contested states, or declare the election "inconclusive" and send it back to state legislatures.</li>

            <p>Under either scenario, Trump would remain president.</p>

            <h2>The Constitutional Ambiguity Eastman Exploited</h2>

            <p>Here's what makes this genuinely concerning: the Constitution's language about counting electoral votes is <em>extremely vague</em>.</p>

            <p>The 12th Amendment says the President of the Senate (the VP) shall "open all the certificates" in the presence of Congress, and then "the votes shall then be counted." But it doesn't say who does the counting or what happens if there are disputes.</p>

            <p>As legal scholar Ned Foley documents in his book <em>Presidential Elections and Majority Rule</em>, this ambiguity has <a href="https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/oso/9780190090777.001.0001/oso-9780190090777">caused confusion and near-crises multiple times in American history</a>. In 1876, it led to the most serious election crisis since the Civil War.</p>

            <p>The Electoral Count Act of 1887 was Congress's attempt to clarify the rules. But as election law expert Rick Hasen wrote in a <a href="https://scholarship.law.uci.edu/ucilr/vol11/iss4/6/">2020 paper for the University of California Irvine Law Review</a>, the ECA itself is "almost impossible to parse" and contains contradictory provisions.</p>

            <h2>The Two-Scenario Plan</h2>

            <p>Eastman actually outlined two versions of his plan, which the <a href="https://january6th.house.gov/sites/democrats.january6th.house.gov/files/20230609%20-%20Chapter%202%20-%20The%20Big%20Lie%20-%205pm.pdf">January 6th Committee documented extensively</a>.</p>

            <p><strong>Version 1 (the "bold" approach):</strong> Pence unilaterally rejects electors from seven states. This would leave neither candidate with 270 electoral votes. Trump would then win because he'd have more of the remaining electoral votes.</p>

            <p><strong>Version 2 (the "more modest" approach):</strong> When objections are raised to contested state electors, Pence announces he cannot decide between competing slates. He sends the question back to state legislatures for a 10-day investigation. During this time, Republican-controlled legislatures could potentially certify Trump electors instead.</p>

            <p>Eastman himself acknowledged the first version was legally dubious. In a January 4, 2021 email revealed in <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cacd.841840/gov.uscourts.cacd.841840.260.1.pdf">court filings</a>, he admitted it wouldn't survive Supreme Court review. But he argued it would "kick the Georgia legislature's certification of Biden electors" and "buy the time" for more challenges.</p>

            <h2>Why This Wasn't Just a Crazy Theory</h2>

            <p>Here's what troubled me when I first studied this: Eastman's plan wasn't completely invented from nothing.</p>

            <p>Vice Presidents <em>have</em> historically played roles in counting electoral votes. In 1960, VP Nixon (presiding over his own loss) made procedural decisions about Hawaii's disputed electors. In 1876, the ambiguity about who counts electoral votes nearly tore the country apart.</p>

            <p>And the "competing slates" weren't just Trump supporters declaring themselves electors. As the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/26/us/politics/trump-fake-electors-charges.html">New York Times documented</a>, these were organized meetings where individuals signed certificates claiming to be the "duly elected" electors for their states. They used official-looking formats. Some even sent their certificates to the National Archives.</p>

            <p>Were these legally valid? No—every relevant state had already certified Biden's victory. But they created enough of a veneer of legitimacy that Eastman could argue there was "ambiguity" requiring resolution.</p>

            <h2>What Actually Happened</h2>

            <p>We know how this ended: Pence refused to go along with the plan.</p>

            <p>According to <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-live-the-jan-6-committee-hearings-day-2">testimony before the January 6th Committee</a>, Pence consulted with conservative legal experts, including former federal judge J. Michael Luttig. They told him unequivocally that he lacked the constitutional authority to reject electoral votes.</p>

            <p>On January 6th, as rioters chanted "hang Mike Pence" outside, Pence proceeded with the normal counting process. He issued a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20457164-pence-letter-on-electoral-college-certification">statement</a> saying: "It is my considered judgment that my oath to support and defend the Constitution constrains me from claiming unilateral authority to determine which electoral votes should be counted and which should not."</p>

            <p>The key word there is "unilateral." Pence was saying: I don't get to decide this alone.</p>

            <h2>Why This Matters for Future Elections</h2>

            <p>The Eastman memo plan failed because one person—Mike Pence—chose not to execute it. That's a very thin safeguard.</p>

            <p>What happens in 2028 if we have a close election, and the Vice President is someone more sympathetic to this theory? What if state legislatures are better coordinated in creating "competing slates"?</p>

            <p>The good news: Congress passed the Electoral Count Reform Act in 2022. According to the <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/congress-passes-electoral-count-reform">Brennan Center's analysis</a>, the new law clarifies that the Vice President's role is purely ministerial. It raises the threshold for objections. It specifies that state governors' certifications are presumed valid.</p>

            <p>But questions remain. The law still allows objections if signed by one-fifth of each chamber. It still has procedures for "failed elections" that could potentially be exploited. And it's just a statute—Congress could change it with a simple majority.</p>

            <p>More fundamentally, the Eastman memos revealed something important: America's election certification process contains genuine ambiguities that sophisticated actors can exploit. These aren't just made-up conspiracies. They're weaknesses in the institutional architecture.</p>

            <h2>The "By the Book" Problem</h2>

            <p>There's something especially insidious about this type of subversion attempt: it's procedural rather than violent.</p>

            <p>Eastman framed his memos in the language of constitutional interpretation and legal precedent. He cited founding fathers and historical examples. He created an intellectual framework that made overturning an election sound like a legitimate legal dispute rather than a coup.</p>

            <p>Political scientists call this "constitutional hardball"—using the letter of ambiguous rules to violate their spirit. Research by constitutional law scholars Joseph Fishkin and David Pozen in their <a href="https://columbialawreview.org/content/asymmetric-constitutional-hardball/">2018 Columbia Law Review article</a> found that this type of norm-breaking, when it becomes one-sided, is a key warning sign of democratic erosion.</p>

            <p>The danger isn't just that someone tries it. The danger is that it makes future attempts seem normal. Each time political actors push procedural boundaries, the next push starts from the new boundary rather than the old norm.</p>

            <h2>Bottom Line: Why Founders Matter</h2>

            <p><strong>Key insight:</strong> Election subversion doesn't require violence or obviously illegal acts. It can happen through exploiting ambiguities in procedural rules, using the <em>form</em> of legality to achieve illegitimate ends.</p>

            <p><strong>For 2026 and 2028:</strong> The Electoral Count Reform Act has closed some of these loopholes, but not all of them. Future subversion attempts will likely focus on earlier stages—state certification, electors' meetings, litigation strategies—rather than January 6th itself.</p>

            <p><strong>Project idea:</strong> One underexplored area is training election officials and secretaries of state on how to respond to these types of procedural pressure campaigns. Organizations like the <a href="https://electioninnovation.org/">Center for Election Innovation & Research</a> work with state officials, but there's room for more focused scenario-planning around constitutional hardball situations.</p>

            <p>The Eastman memos should be studied not as a historical curiosity, but as a playbook. The specific tactics failed in 2020. But the strategy—finding procedural ambiguities and exploiting them with sophisticated legal arguments—remains available for future attempts.</p>

            <p>Understanding this plan in detail helps us see where the real vulnerabilities lie. And it reminds us that democratic safeguards ultimately depend on people choosing to uphold them, even when the rules are ambiguous enough to allow alternatives.</p>
