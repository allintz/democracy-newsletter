            <h2>How Autocrats Capture Courts: The Slow-Motion Playbook</h2>

            <p><strong>Epistemic status:</strong> High confidence on the historical facts and political science research. Medium confidence on which specific mechanisms are most important for US context.</p>

            <p>---</p>

            <p>When we think about threats to democracy, we often imagine dramatic moments: stolen elections, military coups, constitutional crises. But one of the most effective tools for democratic backsliding is much quieter: capturing the judicial system.</p>

            <p>This matters because courts are supposed to be the ultimate referee when politicians break the rules. If you control the courts, you can break democratic norms with legal impunity.</p>

            <p>Let me walk you through how this actually works, using real examples. Then we'll think about what this means for protecting democracy in the US.</p>

            <h2>The Basic Playbook</h2>

            <p>The pattern shows up again and again across different countries. According to <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/695504">research by political scientists Tom Ginsburg and Aziz Huq</a>, judicial capture typically happens through a three-step process that looks legitimate on paper but fundamentally changes how courts work.</p>

            <p>First, you change the rules about how judges are selected or how many judges there are. Second, you fill the courts with loyalists who will rule in your favor. Third, you use those captured courts to legitimize your power grabs.</p>

            <p>The genius of this approach is that each step can be defended as normal democratic politics. "We're just reforming the judiciary!" "We're filling legitimate vacancies!" "We're following what the courts ruled!"</p>

            <p>Let's look at how this played out in two countries where it worked.</p>

            <h2>Hungary: The Speed-Run Version</h2>

            <p>Viktor Orbán's Fidesz party won a supermajority in Hungary's parliament in 2010. Within 18 months, they had effectively captured the judiciary. Here's exactly what they did.</p>

            <p>As documented by <a href="https://www.law.upenn.edu/live/files/6314-schleppele-understand-the-constitutional-revolution">Kim Lane Scheppele, a Princeton legal scholar who tracked the changes in real-time</a>, Fidesz first expanded the Constitutional Court's size and packed it with loyalists. They lowered the retirement age for judges from 70 to 62, which forced 274 judges off the bench. Then they created a new National Judicial Office run by a Fidesz loyalist who controlled all judge appointments and case assignments.</p>

            <p>Each change came with reasonable-sounding justifications. They were "modernizing" the judicial system. They were "ensuring proper administration." They were "aligning Hungary with European standards."</p>

            <p>But the effect was clear. By 2012, Fidesz could pass laws that previously would have been struck down as unconstitutional. When they rewrote election rules to favor their party, the courts approved. When they restricted media freedom, the courts found it constitutional.</p>

            <p>The whole process took less than two years. That's the terrifying part—judicial capture can happen fast if a party has enough power.</p>

            <h2>Poland: Death by a Thousand Cuts</h2>

            <p>Poland's Law and Justice party (PiS) took power in 2015 and pursued a similar strategy, though they faced more resistance. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/11/world/europe/poland-court-judicial-independence.html">According to reporting by the New York Times</a>, PiS created a "disciplinary chamber" that could punish judges for their rulings, forced Supreme Court justices into early retirement, and gave the Justice Minister power to appoint court presidents.</p>

            <p>The disciplinary chamber was particularly clever. PiS claimed they needed it to fight corruption among judges. But in practice, <a href="https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2021-07/cp210128en.pdf">as the European Court of Justice documented</a>, it was used to intimidate judges who ruled against the government.</p>

            <p>Judges who questioned PiS policies faced disciplinary proceedings. Some were removed from high-profile cases. Others saw their salaries cut. The message was clear: rule our way, or face consequences.</p>

            <p>What's interesting about Poland is that it shows judicial capture isn't always complete. The courts fought back. Some judges refused to recognize the legitimacy of the disciplinary chamber. The European Union imposed sanctions. After PiS lost power in 2023, the new government has been trying to restore judicial independence.</p>

            <p>But the damage was real. For years, Poland's courts couldn't effectively check government power.</p>

            <h2>Why Courts Matter So Much</h2>

            <p>You might wonder: why focus on courts specifically? Why not just pack the legislature or control the media?</p>

            <p>The answer is that courts have unique legitimacy. When a court rules something is "constitutional" or "legal," it wraps government action in the language of law and rights. This makes opposition much harder.</p>

            <p><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3290116">A 2018 paper by Mila Versteeg and Tom Ginsburg</a> analyzed 200 episodes of democratic backsliding worldwide. They found that leaders who successfully captured courts were significantly more likely to consolidate authoritarian power. Courts gave them a "legal" path to dismantle democracy.</p>

            <p>Think about it this way: if a leader wants to ignore election results, they need some institution to say it's legal. If they want to jail opponents, they need courts to approve it. If they want to restrict voting rights, they need judicial blessing.</p>

            <p>Captured courts provide that blessing.</p>

            <h2>The US Context: Different Structure, Similar Vulnerabilities</h2>

            <p>The US judicial system looks different from Hungary or Poland. We have life tenure for federal judges. We have stronger traditions of judicial independence. We have multiple levels of courts that can check each other.</p>

            <p>But we're not immune to these dynamics.</p>

            <p>Consider what happened with the Supreme Court over the past decade. Republicans held open Antonin Scalia's seat for over a year in 2016, blocking Merrick Garland's nomination. Then in 2020, they rushed through Amy Coney Barrett's nomination just days before the election.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/senate-judicial-confirmation-process-breakdown">As documented by the Brennan Center for Justice</a>, these weren't normal hardball politics. They represented a fundamental break with previous norms about how Supreme Court seats are filled.</p>

            <p>The result is a 6-3 conservative supermajority that many Democrats see as illegitimately composed. Whether you agree with that characterization or not, the <em>perception</em> of illegitimacy matters. It undermines the Court's ability to serve as a neutral referee.</p>

            <p>And state courts face even more direct pressure. In Arizona, the Republican legislature <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/legislature/2024/02/15/arizona-republicans-threaten-state-supreme-court-justices/72606664007/">threatened to impeach state Supreme Court justices</a> who ruled against their preferred election procedures. In Wisconsin, <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/wisconsin-supreme-court-race-could-break-spending-records">spending on state Supreme Court races has exploded</a>, turning judicial elections into partisan battlegrounds.</p>

            <p>These pressures don't look exactly like Hungary or Poland. But the underlying logic is similar: changing courts to get favorable rulings on election disputes and democratic procedures.</p>

            <h2>What Makes Judicial Capture Succeed or Fail?</h2>

            <p>Based on comparative evidence, a few factors seem to matter most.</p>

            <p><strong>Concentrated power:</strong> Judicial capture is easiest when one party controls enough institutions to change court structures unilaterally. Hungary had a supermajority. Poland had unified government. The US system of checks and balances makes total capture harder—but not impossible, especially at the state level where some legislatures have supermajorities.</p>

            <p><strong>Speed of changes:</strong> Rapid changes are harder to resist because opponents can't organize effectively. When Hungary forced hundreds of judges into retirement simultaneously, there was no time to build a legal or political defense.</p>

            <p><strong>International pressure:</strong> Poland faced significant pushback from the EU, which limited how far PiS could go. The US has no equivalent external check.</p>

            <p><strong>Judicial culture:</strong> Countries with stronger traditions of judicial independence show more resistance. Some Polish judges refused to cooperate with captured institutions. This slowed the process and eventually contributed to PiS's electoral defeat.</p>

            <h2>Bottom Line for Democracy Defenders</h2>

            <p>Here's what this means if you're thinking about projects to protect democratic institutions:</p>

            <p><strong>Courts are a critical vulnerability.</strong> Any serious effort to prevent democratic backsliding needs to include protecting judicial independence. This isn't just about the Supreme Court—state courts matter enormously for election disputes.</p>

            <p><strong>Capture happens through "normal" politics.</strong> The dangerous moves look like typical partisan hardball at first. By the time you realize courts have been captured, it's often too late. Early detection and resistance matters.</p>

            <p><strong>Multiple levels of defense help.</strong> The US has more veto points than Hungary or Poland had. Federal and state courts can check each other. This redundancy is valuable and worth protecting.</p>

            <p><strong>Legitimacy is both a strength and a vulnerability.</strong> Courts derive power from being seen as legitimate. But that same legitimacy makes them attractive targets for capture. Once captured, they can legitimize undemocratic actions.</p>

            <h2>Project Ideas</h2>

            <p>If this topic resonates with you, here are some concrete directions:</p>

            <li><strong>State court monitoring:</strong> Create systems to track changes in state judicial selection processes, threats against judges, and unusual case assignment patterns. Many of the organizations focused on federal courts don't pay enough attention to state-level dynamics.</li>

            <li><strong>Support existing work:</strong> Organizations like the <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/">Brennan Center for Justice</a> and <a href="https://protectdemocracy.org/">Protect Democracy</a> already focus on judicial independence. They often have specific projects that need funding or volunteer support.</li>

            <li><strong>International learning:</strong> We could learn more from countries that have successfully resisted or reversed judicial capture. Poland's recent experience with restoration could be particularly informative.</li>

            <p>The key insight is that protecting courts isn't just about judicial philosophy or political ideology. It's about maintaining institutions that can referee democratic conflicts fairly. Without that, every election becomes a potential crisis.</p>
