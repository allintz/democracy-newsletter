            <h1>Understanding the "Independent State Legislature Theory" and Why It Almost Changed Everything</h1>

            <p><strong>Epistemic status:</strong> High confidence on legal and historical facts (citing primary sources); medium confidence on counterfactual predictions about what might have happened in alternate scenarios.</p>

            <p>In December 2022, the Supreme Court heard arguments in <em>Moore v. Harper</em>, a case that could have fundamentally reshaped how American elections work. The case centered on something called the "independent state legislature theory" (or ISL theory), which argues that state legislatures have nearly unlimited power over federal elections—power that state courts, governors, and even state constitutions can't touch.</p>

            <p>The Court ultimately rejected this theory in June 2023. But here's why you should still understand it: the theory came remarkably close to succeeding, it would have made election subversion much easier, and some version of it could return in future cases.</p>

            <h2>What the Independent State Legislature Theory Claims</h2>

            <p>The theory stems from a particular reading of the Elections Clause in Article I, Section 4 of the Constitution. <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/article-1/section-4/">That clause says</a>: "The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof."</p>

            <p>ISL proponents focus on those words: "the Legislature thereof." They argue this means state <em>legislatures specifically</em>, acting alone, not the state's lawmaking process more broadly.</p>

            <p>Under this interpretation, when a state legislature makes rules for federal elections, those rules would be immune from:</p>

            <li>State court review (even if the rules violate the state constitution)</li>
            <li>Gubernatorial veto</li>
            <li>State constitutional constraints</li>
            <li>Ballot initiatives that modify election rules</li>

            <p>This would represent a radical departure from 200+ years of practice. As <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/independent-state-legislature-theory-explained">the Brennan Center documents</a>, state courts have reviewed legislative election maps and laws for compliance with state constitutions for most of American history.</p>

            <h2>Why This Matters for Election Subversion</h2>

            <p>Let me walk through a concrete scenario to show why this theory is so consequential.</p>

            <p>Imagine it's November 2028. In a crucial swing state, the Democrat wins the presidential vote by 30,000 votes. But the Republican-controlled state legislature isn't happy with this result.</p>

            <p><strong>Under current law:</strong> If the legislature tried to override the popular vote and send a different slate of electors, the state supreme court could strike this down as violating the state constitution. The governor could veto such legislation. State constitutional provisions protecting voting rights would constrain what the legislature can do.</p>

            <p><strong>Under ISL theory:</strong> The legislature could potentially override the popular vote, and state courts couldn't stop them because the Elections Clause gives the power solely to "the Legislature." The governor's veto wouldn't apply. State constitutional protections might not matter.</p>

            <p>This isn't hypothetical fearmongering. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/10/us/politics/supreme-court-election-trump.html">During the 2020 election</a>, Pennsylvania Republican lawmakers actually discussed trying to appoint their own electors despite Biden's popular vote win. What stopped them wasn't lack of will—it was the legal and institutional barriers that ISL theory would have removed.</p>

            <h2>The <em>Moore v. Harper</em> Case: How Close It Came</h2>

            <p>The case involved North Carolina's congressional maps. The state supreme court struck down gerrymandered maps as violating the North Carolina Constitution's free elections clause. The legislature argued this was improper under ISL theory—that <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/21-1271_3f14.pdf">the state court couldn't review the legislature's federal election maps</a>.</p>

            <p>Three Supreme Court justices (Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch) have previously expressed sympathy for ISL theory. Justice Kavanaugh wrote in a 2020 statement that the theory had "text, history, and precedent" supporting it. That meant the theory potentially had four supporters—just one vote short of a majority.</p>

            <p>In June 2023, <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/21-1271_3f14.pdf">the Court rejected ISL theory 6-3</a>, with Chief Justice Roberts writing that state courts retain authority to review legislative election laws under state constitutions. But the decision was narrower than it appeared.</p>

            <p>The Court said state courts can review election laws, but they can't go "too far" in imposing constraints the state constitution doesn't clearly require. This leaves significant ambiguity. What counts as "too far"? The Court didn't say, which means future cases could chip away at state court authority incrementally.</p>

            <h2>Historical Context: This Idea Wasn't Always Fringe</h2>

            <p>Here's what makes ISL theory tricky: it's not entirely made up, even though constitutional scholars overwhelmingly reject it.</p>

            <p>The theory got its modern start in <em>Bush v. Gore</em> (2000), where <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/00-949.ZPC.html">three justices suggested in a concurrence</a> that state courts might not be able to change election rules that state legislatures established. This was dicta (non-binding commentary), but it planted a seed.</p>

            <p>In 2015, <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/13-1314_kjfl.pdf">the Court decided <em>Arizona State Legislature v. Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission</em></a>, upholding Arizona voters' right to take redistricting power away from the legislature through a ballot initiative. This seemed to reject ISL theory. But Chief Justice Roberts dissented, arguing the Elections Clause really does mean "the Legislature" specifically.</p>

            <p>By 2020, with the pandemic forcing rapid changes to election procedures and Trump claiming fraud, ISL theory found new champions. Conservative legal groups began pressing it aggressively.</p>

            <h2>Why Experts Found the Theory Alarming</h2>

            <p>When <em>Moore v. Harper</em> was pending, over 170 members of Congress filed an amicus brief warning about the consequences. <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/independent-state-legislature-theory-explained">The Brennan Center identified</a> several specific dangers:</p>

            <p><strong>Danger 1: Removing checks on gerrymandering.</strong> Many states have constitutional provisions requiring fair districts. ISL theory would make these unenforceable for congressional maps.</p>

            <p><strong>Danger 2: Undermining voter protections.</strong> State constitutions often provide stronger voting rights protections than federal law. ISL theory would prevent state courts from enforcing these for federal elections.</p>

            <p><strong>Danger 3: Creating election subversion opportunities.</strong> This is the big one. Without state court review, a legislature could theoretically override election results by changing the rules after votes are cast, claiming authority under the Elections Clause.</p>

            <p><strong>Danger 4: Diverging state and federal rules.</strong> States would need two sets of election laws—one for state elections (subject to state constitutional limits) and one for federal elections (not subject to those limits). This would create chaos for election administrators.</p>

            <h2>What Actually Happened in 2020 That Made This Matter</h2>

            <p>The theory moved from academic debate to urgent concern because of specific 2020 events.</p>

            <p>In Pennsylvania, <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/121120zr_p860.pdf">Trump's campaign asked the Supreme Court</a> to throw out ballots that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court had allowed to be counted under an extended deadline. The campaign's argument? The Pennsylvania court had overstepped by interpreting Pennsylvania's election laws, violating ISL theory.</p>

            <p>Four justices (Alito, Thomas, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh) indicated they thought this claim had merit, though the Court ultimately didn't grant the relief Trump sought. <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/20pdf/20-542_i42k.pdf">Justice Alito's statement</a> said the issue had "national importance" and should be addressed.</p>

            <p>This was a warning flare. If ISL theory had been established law in 2020, state courts couldn't have protected voting rights expansions in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, and other states where state courts played crucial roles.</p>

            <h2>Where This Stands Now (And Could Go in 2026/2028)</h2>

            <p>The threat isn't over, for three reasons:</p>

            <p><strong>First</strong>, the <em>Moore v. Harper</em> decision left the door open. The Court said state courts can't be "too far" removed from state constitutional text. This vague standard invites future litigation challenging specific state court decisions.</p>

            <p><strong>Second</strong>, the Supreme Court's composition could change. The 6-3 <em>Moore</em> decision included Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Barrett in the majority. A different case with a more sympathetic fact pattern could yield a different result.</p>

            <p><strong>Third</strong>, some state legislators still believe in ISL theory or find it useful. <a href="https://www.azmirror.com/2023/06/27/arizona-republicans-react-to-supreme-court-ruling-on-independent-state-legislature-theory/">Arizona's Republican-controlled legislature</a>, for instance, continued pursuing related theories even after <em>Moore</em> was decided.</p>

            <h2>What This Means for Democracy Protection Work</h2>

            <p>If you're thinking about projects in this space, the ISL theory saga suggests several angles:</p>

            <p><strong>State constitutional reform:</strong> Strengthening state constitutional protections for voting rights matters less if state courts can't enforce them. But post-<em>Moore</em>, this remains valuable work. Organizations like <a href="https://represent.us/">RepresentUs</a> work on state-level democracy reforms including constitutional amendments.</p>

            <p><strong>State court elections:</strong> Since state courts remain (for now) a check on legislature overreach, state supreme court elections matter enormously. Few people pay attention to these races, creating opportunities for outsized impact. The <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/issues/defend-our-courts/state-courts">Brennan Center tracks</a> key state court races.</p>

            <p><strong>Institutional education:</strong> Many legislators, election officials, and even judges don't fully understand these doctrinal debates. Creating clear educational materials explaining why ISL theory threatens democratic norms could influence future cases.</p>

            <p><strong>Federal legislation:</strong> Congress has power under the Elections Clause too ("but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations"). Federal legislation establishing baseline protections could override state legislature overreach, though this faces obvious political obstacles.</p>

            <h2>Bottom Line</h2>

            <p>The independent state legislature theory came within one or two votes of becoming Supreme Court doctrine. Had it succeeded, state legislatures would have gained sweeping, largely unchecked power over federal elections—removing the state-level institutional checks that helped preserve the 2020 election outcome.</p>

            <p>The theory was rejected in 2023, but not decisively. The vague "not too far" standard creates uncertainty and invites continued litigation. And the political incentives that drove ISL theory's rise—partisan advantage through gerrymandering and the potential to influence close presidential elections—haven't disappeared.</p>

            <p>For anyone building background knowledge on threats to democracy, understanding ISL theory reveals something important: election subversion doesn't require conspiracy or violence. It can happen through legal theories that sound technical and boring but would remove the institutional checks that make subversion difficult.</p>

            <p>The 2026 and 2028 elections will occur in a world where ISL theory was rejected but not eliminated. That makes state-level institutions—state courts, state constitutions, governors—more important than ever. And it makes understanding these doctrinal battles essential for anyone working to protect democratic processes.</p>
