            <h1>Democracy Reads: The Doctrine of "Independent State Legislature Theory" and Its 2022-2023 Near-Miss</h1>

            <p>*Building deep background on threats to democracy | Monday, January 12, 2026*</p>

            <p>**Reading time:** ~5 minutes</p>

            <p>---</p>

            <p>Today we're diving into one of the most consequential constitutional theories that almost radically reshaped American election law: the Independent State Legislature (ISL) theory. This isn't just academic history—understanding this doctrine helps explain a major legal strategy deployed in 2020-2022 election challenges, and why the Supreme Court's 2023 rejection of it in *Moore v. Harper* was such a pivotal moment for election integrity.</p>

            <p>**Epistemic status:** High confidence on the basic facts and legal history; moderate confidence on counterfactual impact assessments. The legal theory itself is well-documented through court filings and decisions, though reasonable scholars disagree on how it would have played out in practice.</p>

            <h2>What Is ISL Theory? The Constitutional Argument</h2>

            <p>The Independent State Legislature theory rests on a specific reading of two constitutional clauses. Article I, Section 4 states that "The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof" ([U.S. Constitution, Article I, Section 4](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/article-1/section-4/)). Similarly, Article II, Section 1 says that each state shall appoint electors "in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct."</p>

            <p>The maximalist version of ISL theory argued that the word "Legislature" meant *only* the legislative body itself—not the state's lawmaking process as a whole. Under this interpretation:</p>

            <li>State supreme courts couldn't review election laws for state constitutional violations</li>
            <li>Governors' vetoes might not apply to election legislation</li>
            <li>State constitutions couldn't constrain how legislatures regulate federal elections</li>
            <li>Independent redistricting commissions might be unconstitutional</li>

            <p>As law professor Michael Morley [explained in testimony to Congress](https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Morley%20Testimony.pdf), this would represent "a radical departure from over two centuries of practice and precedent."</p>

            <h2>The 2020 Deployment: Bush v. Gore's Shadow</h2>

            <p>ISL theory wasn't invented in 2020, but that's when it moved from academic journals to high-stakes litigation. The theory had appeared in Chief Justice Rehnquist's concurrence in *Bush v. Gore* (2000), where he argued Florida's Supreme Court had improperly changed election rules ([Bush v. Gore, 531 U.S. 1046, Rehnquist concurrence](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/00-949.ZPC.html)).</p>

            <p>In 2020, Trump campaign lawyers explicitly invoked ISL theory in multiple cases. The [Pennsylvania Republican Party's emergency application to the Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/20/20A54/159145/20201105144530958_2020-11-05%20PA%20Republican%20Party%20Application%20FINAL.pdf) argued that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's extension of the mail ballot deadline violated the Legislature's constitutional authority. Justice Alito, joined by Justices Thomas and Gorsuch, wrote that the case presented "a highly important and recurring constitutional question" about whether state courts could alter election rules ([Republican Party of Pennsylvania v. Boockvar, Statement, October 2020](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/20pdf/20a54_6jfm.pdf)).</p>

            <p>The theory failed in 2020—courts weren't ready to embrace such a dramatic shift. But it had attracted three Supreme Court justices' apparent interest.</p>

            <h2>Moore v. Harper: The Theory Gets Its Day in Court</h2>

            <p>By 2022, ISL theory had a perfect test case. North Carolina's Supreme Court had struck down a congressional map drawn by the Republican legislature, finding it violated the state constitution's partisan gerrymandering prohibitions. Republican legislators appealed to SCOTUS, arguing the Elections Clause gave them exclusive, unreviewable authority ([Moore v. Harper, Petition for Certiorari](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/21/21-1271/218497/20220309151527264_21-1271%20Petition.pdf)).</p>

            <p>Here's what made this case particularly dangerous for election integrity: **timing**. The Supreme Court heard arguments in December 2022, with a decision expected before the 2024 election cycle began in earnest. According to election law expert Rick Hasen, "This case has the potential to be the most important Supreme Court election law case in over two decades" ([Hasen blog post, May 2022](https://electionlawblog.org/?p=130036)).</p>

            <p>The stakes were clear to everyone involved. A coalition of election law scholars—spanning the ideological spectrum—filed an [amicus brief](https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/21/21-1271/233322/20220727164306177_21-1271%20Amici%20Brief%20of%20Election%20Law%20Scholars.pdf) warning that accepting ISL theory would "undermine the rule of law" and create "chaos in election administration."</p>

            <h2>What Would Have Happened If They'd Won?</h2>

            <p>Let's think through the concrete implications if SCOTUS had accepted the strong version of ISL theory:</p>

            <p>**Scenario 1: State court guardrails removed**  </p>
            <p>State supreme courts had been crucial backstops in 2020. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court rejected challenges to mail ballot procedures; the Georgia Supreme Court expedited cases to provide certainty. Under ISL theory, state courts might have been powerless to intervene in future disputes, no matter how clearly a legislature violated state constitutional protections.</p>

            <p>**Scenario 2: Legislature-only certification**  </p>
            <p>The more radical extension of ISL theory could have meant state legislatures held ultimate authority over presidential elector certification. Remember: in January 2021, multiple state Republican legislatures [considered resolutions to dispute their own states' results](https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/01/republicans-biden-electoral-college-453071) (Pennsylvania, Arizona, Georgia). Under strong ISL theory, could a legislature simply override its state's popular vote? This wasn't theoretical—Trump explicitly [called on state legislators to "do their constitutional duty"](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefings-statements/statement-by-the-president-122720/) and challenge results in December 2020.</p>

            <p>**Scenario 3: Last-minute rule changes**  </p>
            <p>Without state court review, nothing would stop a legislature from changing election procedures between election day and certification—potentially invalidating ballots after they'd been cast. As the Brennan Center [noted in their analysis](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/independent-state-legislature-theory-explained), this would create "an open invitation to manipulation."</p>

            <h2>The June 2023 Decision: Why ISL Theory Failed</h2>

            <p>On June 27, 2023, the Supreme Court rejected ISL theory by a 6-3 vote, with Chief Justice Roberts writing for the majority ([Moore v. Harper, 600 U.S. ___ (2023)](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/21-1271_3f14.pdf)). The decision was remarkably clear: state courts retain their traditional authority to review election laws under state constitutions.</p>

            <p>Roberts traced the history back to the Founding, showing that "Legislature" in the Elections Clause meant the state's lawmaking process as a whole—including constitutional constraints, gubernatorial vetoes, and judicial review. The Court found "overwhelming evidence" that state courts had always possessed this review power.</p>

            <p>Importantly, the decision **wasn't unanimous**. Justices Thomas, Alito, and Gorsuch dissented, arguing for a version of ISL theory. Thomas wrote that the majority's interpretation "has no basis in the Constitution" ([Thomas dissent, Moore v. Harper](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/21-1271_3f14.pdf)). This means the theory, while rejected, retains some support on the Court.</p>

            <h2>Why This Matters: Counterfactuals and Close Calls</h2>

            <p>We came closer than most people realize to a fundamental shift in American election law. Consider the timeline:</p>

            <li>**October 2020**: Three justices signal interest in ISL theory</li>
            <li>**2021-2022**: Republican-controlled legislatures in multiple states pass election laws that state courts then strike down (Wisconsin, North Carolina, Pennsylvania)</li>
            <li>**December 2022**: SCOTUS hears Moore v. Harper</li>
            <li>**June 2023**: ISL theory rejected, but only 6-3</li>

            <p>If Justice Barrett or Kavanaugh had voted differently—or if the Court's composition had shifted slightly—state courts could have lost their power to enforce state constitutional protections in federal elections. Given that state courts [blocked or modified over 100 election-related laws between 2020-2023](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/court-cases?case_type=All&state=All), this would have fundamentally altered the landscape.</p>

            <h2>Lessons for Democracy Protection</h2>

            <p>**Lesson 1: Constitutional theories matter**  </p>
            <p>ISL theory demonstrates how abstract legal doctrines can become real threats. The theory existed in law reviews for years before becoming a litigation strategy. Monitoring which constitutional theories gain traction in conservative/progressive legal circles provides early warning.</p>

            <p>**Lesson 2: Institutions are only as strong as their defenders**  </p>
            <p>The fact that three Supreme Court justices were willing to embrace such a radical departure from precedent shows that institutional norms alone won't protect democracy. Chief Justice Roberts' majority opinion was crucial—one more vote the other way changes everything.</p>

            <p>**Lesson 3: State courts are critical infrastructure**  </p>
            <p>We often focus on federal institutions, but state supreme courts were repeatedly decisive in 2020-2022. Their ability to enforce state constitutional protections provided a crucial safeguard. Any theory that removes this check deserves scrutiny.</p>

            <p>**Lesson 4: The theory isn't dead**  </p>
            <p>Three justices still support some version of ISL theory. If the Court's composition shifts, or if a future case presents the theory in a more limited form, it could return. Democracy protection requires sustained vigilance, not just celebrating individual victories.</p>

            <h2>Bottom Line</h2>

            <p>The Independent State Legislature theory represents a category of threat that's easy to miss: constitutional reinterpretation that could fundamentally alter democratic safeguards. Unlike a coup or obvious election fraud, ISL theory operated through facially legitimate legal argument. It attracted serious judicial consideration and came within one or two votes of succeeding.</p>

            <p>The theory's rejection in *Moore v. Harper* was a major victory for election integrity, but the 6-3 vote and the theory's prominence in 2020 litigation show how close we came to eliminating a crucial democratic guardrail. Understanding ISL theory isn't just historical—it's a template for recognizing how future attempts at democratic backsliding might use constitutional reinterpretation as cover.</p>
